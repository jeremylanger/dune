      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I think they’ll follow you, Gurney Halleck.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘ ’Tis to be hoped.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Indeed.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I may make my own decision in this, then?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your own decision.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his reserve strength even that small effort required.
         ‘For now, I’ll see to their quarters and well-being,’ he said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Consult my quartermaster,’ Tuek said. ‘Drisq is his name. Tell him it’s my wish that you receive every courtesy. I’ll join
         you myself presently. I’ve some off-shipments of spice to see to first.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Fortune passes everywhere,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Everywhere,’ Tuek said. ‘A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our business.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck nodded, heard the faint susurration and felt the air shift as a lockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked
         through it and out of the office.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by Tuek’s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow
         area chewed out of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The ceiling stretched
         away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal air-convection currents. Weapons
         racks and lockers lined the walls.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standing – no relaxation in weariness and
         defeat for them. Smuggler medics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled in one area down
         to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Atreides training – <em>‘We care for our own!’ –</em> it held like a core of native rock in them, Halleck noted.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck’s nine-string baliset out of its case. The man snapped a salute, <a id="page293"/>said: ‘Sir, the medics here say there’s no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here – only outpost medicine.
         Mattai can’t last, they say, and he has a request of you.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What is it?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. ‘Mattai wants a song to ease his going, sir. He says you’ll know the one … he’s
         asked it of you often enough.’ The lieutenant swallowed. ‘It’s the one called “My Woman,” sir. If you—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I know.’ Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch on the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the
         instrument, found that someone had already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of his thoughts
         as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to smile casually.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Several of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters. One of the men began singing softly as Halleck
         approached, catching the counter-beat with the ease of long familiarity:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote class="linegroup">
         <p class="line">‘My woman stands at her window,</p>
         
         <p class="line">Curved lines ‘gainst square glass.</p>
         
         <p class="line">Uprais’d arms … bent … downfolded</p>
         
         <p class="line">‘Gainst sunset red and golded—</p>
         
         <p class="line">Come to me …</p>
         
         <p class="line">Come to me, warm arms of my lass.</p>
         
         <p class="line">For me …</p>
         
         <p class="line">For me, the warm arms of my lass.’</p>
         
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">The singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the man on the litter.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: <em>Now we are seventy-three.</em></p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <p class="noindent">Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of
            it. My father had only one real friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of the deadliest
            fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought <a id="page294"/>a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on
            my father as a matter of self-protecdon. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement
            could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became
            adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I’m
            not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new slave-concubine,
            then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer’s muscles, and her training obviously had included
            neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: ‘She is too
            beautiful. We will save her as a gift.’ You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche.
            Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.

      <p class="noindent">Paul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon. The crevasse where he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow. He
         stared out across the open sand at the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in the tent.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Folds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their shelter. Away from the setting sun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black
         they were like bits of night.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And the flatness.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">His mind searched for something tall in that landscape. But there was no persuading tallness out of heat-addled air and that
         horizon – no bloom or gently shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze … only dunes and that distant cliff beneath a sky
         of burnished silver-blue.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>What if there isn’t one of the abandoned testing stations across there?</em> he wondered. <em>What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an accident?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Within the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at Paul. He stood with
         <a id="page295"/>his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising within her
         and turned away.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently she adjusted her stillsuit, refreshed herself with water from the tent’s catchpocket, and slipped out to stand and
         stretch the sleep from her muscles.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul spoke without turning: ‘I find myself enjoying the quiet here.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>How the mind gears itself for its environment,</em> she thought. And she recalled a Bene Gesserit axiom: <em>‘The mind can go either direction under stress – toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum
            whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyper-consciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will
            lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It could be a good life here,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She tried to see the desert through his eyes, seeking to encompass all the rigors this planet accepted as commonplace, wondering
         at the possible futures Paul had glimpsed. <em>One could be alone out here,</em> she thought, <em>without fear of someone behind you, without fear of the hunter.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She stepped past Paul, lifted her binoculars, adjusted the oil lenses and studied the escarpment across from them. Yes, saguaro
         in the arroyos and other spiny growth … and a matting of low grasses, yellow-green in the shadows.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll strike camp,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica nodded, walked to the fissure’s mouth where she could get a sweep of the desert, and swung her binoculars to the left.
         A salt pan glared white there with a blending of dirty tan at its edges – a field of white out here where white was death.
         But the pan said another thing: <em>water.</em> At some time water had flowed across that glaring white. She lowered her binoculars, adjusted her burnoose, listened for
         a moment to the sound of Paul’s movements.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The sun dipped lower. Shadows stretched across the salt pan. Lines of wild color spread over the sunset horizon. Color streamed
         into a toe of darkness testing the sand. Coal-colored shadows spread, and the thick collapse of night blotted the desert.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page296"/>Stars!
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She stared up at them, sensing Paul’s movements as he came up beside her. The desert night focused upward with a feeling of
         lift toward the stars. The weight of the day receded. There came a brief flurry of breeze across her face.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The first moon will be up soon,’ Paul said. ‘The pack’s ready. I’ve planted the thumper.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>We could be lost forever in this hellplace,</em> she thought. And no one to know.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the smell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Smell that,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I can smell it even through the filter,’ she said. ‘Riches. But will it buy water?’ She pointed across the basin. ‘There
         are no artificial lights across there.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right: the first moon. It lifted into view, the hand pattern plain on its
         face. Jessica studied the white-silver of sand exposed in the light.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse,’ Paul said. ‘Whenever I light its candle it’ll give us about thirty
         minutes.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Thirty minutes?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Before it starts calling … a … worm.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Oh. I’m ready to go.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their fissure.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The night is a tunnel,</em> she thought, <em>a hole into tomorrow … if we’re to have a tomorrow.</em> She shook her head. <em>Why must I be so morbid? I was trained better than that!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul returned, took up the pack, led the way down to the first spreading dune where he stopped and listened as his mother
         came up behind him. He heard her soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of sand – the desert’s own code spelling
         out its measure of safety.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page297"/>‘We must walk without rhythm,’ Paul said and he called up memory of men walking the sand … both prescient memory and real
         memory.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Watch how I do it,’ he said. ‘This is how Fremen walk the sand.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of it, moved with a dragging pace.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him. She saw the sense of it: they must sound like the natural
         shifting of sand … like the wind. But muscles protested this unnatural, broken pattern: Step … drag … drag … step … step …
         wait … drag … step …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Time stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no nearer. The one behind still towered high.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was a drumming from the cliff behind.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The thumper,’ Paul hissed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Its pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it in their stride.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Lump … lump … lump … lump …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollow thumping. Down and up through spilling dunes: step … drag … wait … step
         … Across pea sand that rolled under their feet: drag … wait … step …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage masked it. But it grew … louder and louder … out of
         the west.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Lump … lump … lump … lump …’ drummed the thumper.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The hissing approach spread across the night behind them. They turned their heads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing
         worm.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Keep moving,’ Paul whispered. ‘Don’t look back.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left. It was a flailing avalanche of noise.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Keep moving,’ Paul repeated.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the <a id="page298"/>two rock faces – the one ahead and the one behind – appeared equally remote.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated the night.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They moved on and on and on … Muscles reached a stage of mechanical aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul
         saw that the beckoning escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica moved in a void of concentration, aware that the pressure of her will alone kept her walking. Dryness ached in her
         mouth, but the sounds behind drove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuit’s catchpockets.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Lump … lump …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Renewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff, drowning out the thumper.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Silence!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Faster,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action to tell herself that it was necessary to demand even
         more from muscles that already were being taxed to their limits – the unnatural movement …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul saw a plane of flat sand stretching out at the base.
         He stepped onto it, stumbled in his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary outthrusting of a foot.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Resonant booming shook the sand around them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul lurched sideways two steps.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Boom! Boom!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Drum sand!’Jessica hissed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul recovered his balance. A sweeping glance took in the sand around them, the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters
         away.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Behind them, he heard a hissing – like the wind, like a riptide where there was no water.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Run!’Jessica screamed. ‘Paul, run!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They ran.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Drum sound boomed beneath their feet. Then they were out of it and into pea gravel. For a time, the running was a relief to
         <a id="page299"/>muscles that ached from unfamiliar, rhythmless use. Here was action that could be understood. Here was rhythm. But sand and
         gravel dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of the worm was storm sound that grew around them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue and the sound and the terror.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul dragged her up.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They ran on, hand in hand.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them. They passed it, saw another.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica’s mind failed to register on the poles until they were past.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was another – wind-etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Rock!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She felt it through her feet, the shock of unresisting surface, gained new strength from the firmer footing.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff ahead of them. They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow
         hole.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Behind them, the sound of the worm’s passage stopped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica and Paul turned, peered out onto the desert.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Where the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock beach, a silver-gray curve broached from the desert,
         sending rivers of sand and dust cascading all around. It lifted higher, resolved into a giant, questing mouth. It was a round,
         black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled. Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed
         from crystal teeth.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Back and forth the great mouth wove.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stilled his breathing.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica crouched staring.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down the primal terrors, subduing a race-memory fear that
         threatened to fill her mind.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul felt a kind of elation. In some recent instant, he had <a id="page300"/>crossed a time barrier into more unknown territory. He could sense the darkness ahead, nothing revealed to his inner eye.
         It was as though some step he had taken had plunged him into a well … or into the trough of a wave where the future was invisible.
         The landscape had undergone a profound shifting.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Instead of frightening him, the sensation of time-darkness forced a hyper-acceleration of his other senses. He found himself
         registering every available aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him. Its mouth was some eighty meters
         in diameter … crystal teeth with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim … the bellows breath of cinnamon,
         subtle aldehydes … acids …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A shower of small stones and sand cascaded into the
         narrow hiding place.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul crowded his mother farther back.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Cinnamon!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The smell of it flooded across him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>What has the worm to do with the spice, melange?</em> he asked himself. And he remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Barrrroooom!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again: ‘Barrrroooom!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Another thumper!</em> Paul thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again it sounded off to their right.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A shudder passed through the worm. It drew farther away into the sand. Only a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell
         mouth, the curve of a tunnel rearing above the dunes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Sand rasped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The creature sank farther, retreating, turning. It became a mound of cresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the
         dunes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page301"/>Paul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste toward the new thumper summons.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica followed, listening: ‘Lump … lump … lump … lump … lump …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently the sound stopped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica focused on his action, but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the aftermath of terror. ‘Has it gone for sure?’ she
         whispered.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Somebody called it,’ Paul said. ‘Fremen.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She felt herself recovering. ‘It was so big!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not as big as the one that got our ’thopter.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Are you sure it was Fremen?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They used a thumper.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why would they help us?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Maybe they weren’t helping us. Maybe they were just calling a worm.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">An answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come. He had a vision in his mind of something to do with
         the telescoping barbed sticks in their packs – the ‘maker hooks.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why would they call a worm?’Jessica asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away from his mother, to look up the cliff. ‘We’d better
         find a way up there before daylight.’ He pointed. ‘Those poles we passed – there are more of them.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She looked, following the line of his hand, saw the poles – wind-scratched markers – made out the shadow of a narrow ledge
         that twisted into a crevasse high above them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They mark a way up the cliff,’ Paul said. He settled his shoulders into the pack, crossed to the foot of the ledge and began
         the climb upward.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Up they climbed, following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a narrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page302"/>Paul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place. He could feel the precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge,
         but forced himself to slow caution. He saw only darkness within the crevasse. It stretched away upward, open to the stars
         at the top. His ears searched, found only sounds he could expect – a tiny spill of sand, an insect <em>brrr,</em> the patter of a small running creature. He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock beneath a gritting
         surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for his mother to follow. He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped
         her around.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips. Paul saw his mother beside him as a cloudy gray movement. ‘If we
         could only risk a light,’ he whispered.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We have other senses than eyes,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other foot, met an obstruction. He lifted his foot, found
         a step, pulled himself up onto it. He reached back, felt his mother’s arm, tugged at her robe for her to follow.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another step.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It goes on up to the top, I think,’ he whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Shallow and even steps,</em> Jessica thought. <em>Man-carved beyond a doubt.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She followed the shadowy movement of Paul’s progress, feeling out the steps. Rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost
         brushed them. The steps ended in a slitted defile about twenty meters long, its floor level, and this opened onto a shallow,
         moonlit basin.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: ‘What a beautiful place.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">In spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and
         the aching desire for rest, this basin’s beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Like a fairyland,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica nodded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Spreading away in front of her stretched desert growth – bushes, cacti, tiny clumps of leaves – all trembling in the <a id="page303"/>moonlight. The ringwalls were dark to her left, moonfrosted on her right.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This must be a Fremen place,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There would have to be people for this many plants to survive,’ she agreed. She uncapped the tube to her stillsuit’s catchpockets,
         sipped at it. Warm, faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat. She marked how it refreshed her. The tube’s cap grated
         against flakes of sand as she replaced it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Movement caught Paul’s attention – to his right and down on the basin floor curving out beneath them. He stared down through
         smoke bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an <em>up-hop, jump, pop-hop</em> of tiny motion.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mice!’ he hissed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Pop-hop-hop!</em> they went, into shadows and out.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Something fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice. There came a thin screech, a flapping of wings, and a ghostly gray
         bird lifted away across the basin with a small, dark shadow in its talons.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>We needed that reminder,</em> Jessica thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul continued to stare across the basin. He inhaled, sensed the softly cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night.
         The predatory bird – he thought of it as the way of this desert. It had brought a stillness to the basin so unuttered that
         the blue-milk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbush. There was a low humming
         of light here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’d better find a place to pitch the tent,’ he said. ‘Tomorrow we can try to find the Fremen who—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the moment. The voice came from above them and to their
         right.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Please do not run, intruders,’ the voice said as Paul made to withdraw into the defile. ‘If you run you’ll only waste your
         body’s water.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They want us for the water of our flesh!</em> Jessica thought. Her muscles overrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness without <a id="page304"/>external betrayal. She pinpointed the location of the voice, thinking: <em>Such stealth! I didn’t hear him.</em> And she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only the small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another voice called from the basin’s rim to their left. ‘Make it quick, Stil. Get their water and let’s be on our way. We’ve
         little enough time before dawn.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that
         he had clouded his abilities by a momentary panic. He forced himself now to obey her teachings: relax, then fall into the
         semblance of relaxation, then into the arrested whipsnap of muscles that can slash in any direction.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Still, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source. This was blind time, no future he had seen … and they were
         caught between wild Fremen whose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies.

      <p class="noindent"><a id="page305"/>The man crawled across a dunetop. He was a mote caught in the glare of the noon sun. He was dressed only in torn remnants
         of a jubba cloak, his skin bare to the heat through the tatters. The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but the man had
         fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth. Wisps of sandy hair protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick
         brows. Beneath the blue-within-blue eyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks. A matted depression across mustache
         and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked out its path from nose to catchpockets.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man stopped half across the dunecrest, arms stretched down the slipface. Blood had clotted on his back and on his arms
         and legs. Patches of yellow-gray sand clung to the wounds. Slowly, he brought his hands under him, pushed himself to his feet,
         stood there swaying. And even in this almost-random action there remained a trace of once-precise movement.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am Liet-Kynes,’ he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and his voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength
         it had known. ‘I am His Imperial Majesty’s Planetologist,’ he whispered, ‘planetary ecologist for Arrakis. I am steward of
         this land.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face. His hands dug feebly into the sand.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I am steward of this sand,</em> he thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He realized that he was semi-delirious, that he should dig himself into the sand, find the relatively cool underlayer and
         cover himself with it. But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esthers of a pre-spice pocket somewhere underneath this
         sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that
         meant the gases deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">His hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A thought spread across his mind – clear, distinct: <em>The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization – agriculture.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">And he thought how strange it was that his mind, long fixed <a id="page306"/>on a single track, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him here without water or stillsuit, thinking
         a worm would get him if the desert didn’t. They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the impersonal
         hands of his planet.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen,</em> he thought. <em>We don’t die easily. I should be dead now … I will be dead soon … but I can’t stop being an ecologist.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was dead. It was the voice of his father who had been
         planetologist here before him – his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son,’ his father said. ‘You should’ve known the consequences of trying to help the child
         of that Duke.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I’m delirious,</em> Kynes thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through sand, turning to look in that direction – nothing
         except a curving stretch of dune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for life,’ his father said. And the voice came now from
         his left, from behind him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Why does he keep moving around?</em> Kynes asked himself. <em>Doesn’t he want me to see him?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life,’ his father said. ‘Life makes needed nutrients more readily
         available. It binds more energy into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to organism.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Why does he keep harping on the same subject?</em> Kynes asked himself. <em>I knew that before I was ten.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Desert hawks, carrion-eaters in this land as were most wild creatures, began to circle over him. Kynes saw a shadow pass near
         his hand, forced his head farther around to look upward. The birds were a blurred patch on silver-blue sky – distant flecks
         of soot floating above him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page307"/>‘We are generalists,’ his father said. ‘You can’t draw neat lines around planet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit
         science.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>What’s he trying to tell me?</em> Kynes wondered. <em>Is there some consequence I failed to see?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">His cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned rock odor beneath the pre-spice gases. From some corner
         of logic in his mind, a thought formed: <em>Those are carrion-eater birds over me. Perhaps some of my Fremen will see them and come to investigate.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘To the working planetologist, his most important tool is human beings,’ his father said. ‘You must cultivate ecological literacy
         among the people. That’s why I’ve created this entirely new form of ecological notation.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He’s repeating things he said to me when I was a child,</em> Kynes thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: <em>The sun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you’re hot; the sun is burning the moisture out of your body.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">His fingers clawed feebly at the sand.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They couldn’t even leave me a stillsuit!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too-rapid evaporation from living bodies,’ his father said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Why does he keep repeating the obvious?</em> Kynes wondered.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He tried to think of moisture in the air – grass covering this dune … open water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing
         with water across the desert, and trees lining it … He had never seen water open to the sky except in text illustrations.
         Open water … irrigation water … it took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per growing season,
         he remembered.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Our first goal on Arrakis,’ his father said, ‘is grassland provinces. We will start with these mutated poverty grasses. When
         we have moisture locked in grasslands, we’ll move on to start upland forests, then a few open bodies of water – small at first
         – and situated along lines of prevailing winds with windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what
         the wind steals. We must create a true sirocco – a moist <a id="page308"/>wind – but we will never get away from the necessity for windtraps.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Always lecturing me,</em> Kynes thought. <em>Why doesn’t he shut up? Can’t he see I’m dying?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You will die, too,’ his father said, ‘if you don’t get off the bubble that’s forming right now deep underneath you. It’s
         there and you know it. You can smell the pre-spice gases. You know the little makers are beginning to lose some of their water
         into the mass.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The thought of that water beneath him was maddening. He imagined it now – sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery
         half-plant, half-animal little makers – and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest, pure, liquid, soothing
         water into …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A pre-spice mass!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around him than it had been.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried flapping of wings.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>This is spice desert,</em> he thought. <em>There must be Fremen about even in the day sun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life,’ his father said. ‘Nomad peoples follow the same necessity.
         Lines of movement adjust to physical needs for water, food, minerals. We must control this movement now, align it for our
         purposes.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shut up, old man,’ Kynes muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet,’ his father said. ‘We must use man as a constructive
         ecological force – inserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place – to transform the
         water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shut up!’ Kynes croaked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship between worms and spice,’ his father said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A worm,</em> Kynes thought with a surge of hope. <em>A maker’s sure to come when this bubble bursts. But I have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker without hooks?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained <a id="page309"/>to him. Water so near – only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to come, but no way to trap it on the surface
         and use it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression his movements had defined. He felt sand hot against
         his left cheek, but the sensation was remote.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of native life forms,’ his father said. ‘How strange
         that so few people ever looked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near-ideal nitrogen-oxygen-CO<sub>2</sub> balance being maintained here in the absence of large areas of plant cover. The energy sphere of the planet is there to see
         and understand – a relentless process, but a process nonetheless. There is a gap in it? Then something occupies that gap.
         Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained. I knew the little maker was there, deep
         in the sand, long before I ever saw it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Please stop lecturing me, Father,’ Kynes whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it fold its wings, tip its head to stare at him. He summoned
         the energy to croak at it. The bird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets before now,’ his father said. ‘Nature tends to compensate
         for diseases, to remove or encapsulate them, to incorporate them into the system in her own way.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them. It transferred its attention to his outstretched hand.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The historical system of mutual pillage and extortions stops here on Arrakis,’ his father said. ‘You cannot go on forever
         stealing what you need without regard to those who come after. The physical qualities of a planet are written into its economic
         and political record. We have the record in front of us and our course is obvious.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He never could stop lecturing,</em> Kynes thought. <em>Lecturing, lecturing, lecturing – always lecturing.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes’ outstretched <a id="page310"/>hand, turned its head first one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Arrakis is a one-crop planet,’ his father said. ‘One crop. It supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived
         in all times while, beneath them, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings. It’s the masses and the leavings
         that occupy our attention. These are far more valuable than has ever been suspected.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m ignoring you, Father,’ Kynes whispered. ‘Go away.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And he thought: <em>Surely there must be some of my Fremen near. They cannot help but see the birds over me. They will investigate if only to
            see if there’s moisture available.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The masses of Arrakis will know that we work to make the land flow with water,’ his father said. ‘Most of them, of course,
         will have only a semimystical understanding of how we intend to do this. Many, not understanding the prohibitive mass-ratio
         problem, may even think we’ll bring water from some other planet rich in it. Let them think anything they wish as long as
         they believe in us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>In a minute I’ll get up and tell him what I think of him,</em> Kynes thought. <em>Standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The bird took another hop closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand. Two more hawks drifted down to the sand behind it.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same,’ his father said. ‘An act of disobedience must be a sin and require
         religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must depend
         not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Where is my population now when I need it most?</em> Kynes thought. He summoned all his strength, moved his hand a finger’s width toward the nearest hawk. It hopped backward
         among its companions and all stood poised for flight.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon,’ his father said. A planet’s life is a vast, tightly interwoven
         fabric. Vegetation and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we manipulate. As they establish
         themselves, though, our changes will become controlling <a id="page311"/>influences in their own right – and we will have to deal with them, too. Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three
         per cent of the energy surface – only three per cent – to tip the entire structure over into our self-sustaining system.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Why aren’t you helping me?</em> Kynes wondered. <em>Always the same: when I need you most, you fail me.</em> He wanted to turn his head, to stare in the direction of his father’s voice, stare the old man down. Muscles refused to answer
         his demand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a time while its companions waited in mock indifference.
         The hawk stopped only a hop away from his hand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A profound clarity filled Kynes’ mind. He saw quite suddenly a potential for Arrakis that his father had never seen. The possibilities
         along that different path flooded through him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,’ his father said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Reading my mind!</em> Kynes thought. <em>Well … let him.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The messages already have been sent to my sietch villages,</em> he thought. <em>Nothing can stop them. If the Duke’s son is alive they’ll find him and protect him as I have commanded. They may discard the
            woman, his mother, but they’ll save the boy.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The hawk took one hop that brought it within slashing distance of his hand. It tipped its head to examine the supine flesh.
         Abruptly, it straightened, stretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and banked away overhead
         with its companions behind it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They’ve come!</em> Kynes thought. <em>My Fremen have found me!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then he heard the sand rumbling.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath
         him, the pre-spice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had reached the critical stage
         of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous ‘blow’ with
         a dust whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration. <a id="page312"/>They knew what was happening. Any desert creature would know.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>And I am a desert creature,</em> Kynes thought. <em>You see me, Father? I am a desert creature.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He felt the bubble lift him, felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf him, dragging him down into cool darkness. For a
         moment, the sensation of coolness and the moisture were blessed relief. Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes
         that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident
         and error.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Even the hawks could appreciate these facts.</p>

      <p class="noindent"><em>‘Get their water,’</em> the man calling out of the night had said. And Paul fought down his fear, glanced at his mother. His trained eyes saw her
         readiness for battle, the waiting whipsnap of her muscles.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand,’ the voice above them said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>That’s the one who spoke to us first,</em> Jessica thought. <em>There are at least two of them – one to our right and one on our left.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas lele pal hrobas!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was the man to their right calling out across the basin.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">To Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit training, Jessica recognized the speech. It was Chakobsa,
         one of the ancient hunting languages, and the man above <a id="page313"/>them was saying that perhaps these were the strangers they sought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoop-wheel face of the second moon – faintly ivory blue – rolled
         over the rocks across the basin, bright and peering.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Scrambling sounds came from the rocks – above and to both sides … dark motions in the moonlight. Many figures flowed through
         the shadows.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A whole troop!</em> Paul thought with a sudden pang.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica. His mouth baffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing
         a heavy beard in the sidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his hood.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What have we here – jinn or human?’ he asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Jessica heard the true-banter in his voice, she allowed herself a faint hope. This was the voice of command, the voice
         that had first shocked them with its intrusion from the night.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Human, I warrant,’ the man said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in the fold of the man’s robe. She permitted herself one bitter regret that
         she and Paul had no shields.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you also speak?’ the man asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and voice. Reply was urgent, but she had not heard enough
         of this man to be certain she had a register on his culture and weaknesses.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?’ she demanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow relaxation that revealed much. The man had good control.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each of them a clearer arena of action.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The hooded head turned at Paul’s movement, opening a wedge of face to moonlight. Jessica saw a sharp nose, one glinting eye
         – <em>dark, so dark the eye, without any white in it –</em> a heavy brow and upturned mustache.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A likely cub,’ the man said. ‘If you’re fugitives from the <a id="page314"/>Harkonnens, it may be you’re welcome among us. What is it, boy?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The possibilities flashed through Paul’s mind: <em>A trick? A fact?</em> Immediate decision was needed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why should you welcome fugitives?’ he demanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A child who thinks and speaks like a man,’ the tall man said. ‘Well, now to answer your question, my young wali, I am one
         who does not pay the fai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why I might welcome a fugitive.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He knows who we are,</em> Paul thought. <em>There’s concealment in his voice.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am Stilgar, the Fremen,’ the tall man said. ‘Does that speed your tongue, boy?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It is the same voice,</em> Paul thought. And he remembered the Council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I know you, Stilgar,’ Paul said. ‘I was with my father in Council when you came for the water of your friend. You took away
         with you my father’s man, Duncan Idaho – an exchange of friends.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for attack.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice from the rocks above them called: ‘We waste time here, Stil.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is the Duke’s son,’ Stilgar barked. ‘He’s certainly the one Liet told us to seek.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But … a child, Stil.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper,’ Stilgar said. ‘That was a brave crossing he made in the path of <em>shaihulud.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already passed sentence?</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We haven’t time for the test,’ the voice above them protested.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He’s looking for an omen!</em> Jessica thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But the woman,’ the voice above them said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page315"/>‘Yes, the woman,’ Stilgar said. ‘And her water.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You know the law,’ said the voice from the rocks. ‘One who cannot live with the desert—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Be quiet,’ Stilgar said. ‘Times change.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Did Liet <em>command</em> this?’ asked the voice from the rocks.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis,’ Stilgar said. ‘Why do you press me?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Jessica thought: <em>Cielago!</em> The clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of understanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant <em>bat,</em> a small flying mammal. <em>Voice of the cielago:</em> they had received a distrans message to seek Paul and herself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar,’ said the voice above them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My duty is the strength of the tribe,’ Stilgar said. ‘That is my only duty. I need no one to remind me of it. This child-man
         interests me. He is full-fleshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away from the father sun. He has not the eyes of
         the Ibad. Yet he does not speak or act like a weakling of the pans. Nor did his father. How can this be?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We cannot stay out here all night arguing,’ said the voice from the rocks. ‘If a patrol—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving, crossing by a leap over a defile and working his way down
         to the basin floor on their left.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The voice of the cielago suggested there’d be value to us in saving you two,’ Stilgar said. ‘I can see possibility in this
         strong boy-man: he is young and can learn. But what of yourself, woman?’ He stared at Jessica.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I have his voice and pattern registered now,</em> Jessica thought. <em>I could control him with a word, but he’s a strong man … worth much more to us unblunted and with full freedom of action.
            We shall see.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am the mother of this boy,’ Jessica said. ‘In part, his strength which you admire is the product of my training.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The strength of a woman can be boundless,’ Stilgar said. ‘Certain it is in a Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page316"/>For the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered truthfully, ‘No.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Are you trained in the ways of the desert?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No, but many consider my training valuable.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We make our own judgments on value,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Every man has the right to his own judgments,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is well that you see the reason,’ Stilgar said. ‘We cannot dally here to test you, woman. Do you understand? We’d not
         want your shade to plague us. I will take the boy-man, your son, and he shall have my countenance, sanctuary in my tribe.
         But for you, woman – you understand there is nothing personal in this? It is the rule, Istislah, in the general interest.
         Is that not enough?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul took a half-step forward. ‘What are you talking about?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar flicked a glance across Paul, but kept his attention on Jessica. ‘Unless you’ve been deep-trained from childhood to
         live here, you could bring destruction onto an entire tribe. It is the law, and we cannot carry useless …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica’s motion started as a slumping, deceptive faint to the ground. It was the obvious thing for a weak outworlder to do,
         and the obvious slows an opponent’s reactions. It takes an instant to interpret a known thing when that thing is exposed as
         something unknown. She shifted as she saw his right shoulder drop to bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on
         her new position. A turn, a slash of her arm, a whirling of mingled robes, and she was against the rocks with the man helpless
         in front of her.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">At his mother’s first movement, Paul backed two steps. As she attacked, he dove for shadows. A bearded man rose up in his
         path, half-crouched, lunging forward with a weapon in one hand. Paul took the man beneath the sternum with a straight-hand
         jab, sidestepped and chopped the base of his neck, relieving him of the weapon as he fell.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then Paul was into the shadows, scrambling upward among the rocks, the weapon tucked into his waist sash. He had recognized
         it in spite of its unfamiliar shape – a projectile weapon, and that said many things about this place, another clue that shields
         were not used here.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page317"/><em>They will concentrate on my mother and that Stilgar fellow. She can handle him. I must get to a safe vantage point where I
            can threaten them and give her time to escape.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">There came a chorus of sharp spring-clicks from the basin. Projectiles whined off the rocks around him. One of them flicked
         his robe. He squeezed around a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow vertical crack, began inching upward – his back
         against one side, his feet against the other – slowly, as silently as he could.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The roar of Stilgar’s voice echoed up to him: ‘Get back, you worm-headed lice! She’ll break my neck if you come near!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A voice out of the basin said: ‘The boy got away, Stil. What are we—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Of course he got away, you sand-brained … Ugh-h-h! Easy, woman!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Tell them to stop hunting my son,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’ve stopped, woman. He got away as you intended him to. Great gods below! Why didn’t you say you were a weirding woman
         and a fighter?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Tell your men to fall back,’Jessica said. ‘Tell them to go out into the basin where I can see them … and you’d better believe
         that I know how many of them there are.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And she thought: <em>This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp-minded as I think him, we have a chance.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest and look down into the basin. Stilgar’s voice came
         up to him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And if I refuse? How can you … ugh-h-h! Leave be, woman! We mean no harm to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the
         strongest of us, you’re worth ten times your weight of water.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Now, the test of reason,</em> Jessica thought. She said: ‘You ask after the Lisan al-Gaib.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You could be the folk of the legend,’ he said, ‘but I’ll believe that when it’s been tested. All I know now is that you came
         here with that stupid Duke who … Aiee-e-e! Woman! I care not if you kill me! He was honorable and brave, but it was stupid
         to put himself in the way of the Harkonnen fist!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page318"/>Silence.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, Jessica said: ‘He had no choice, but we’ll not argue it. Now, tell that man of yours behind the bush over there
         to stop trying to bring his weapon to bear on me, or I’ll rid the universe of you and take him next.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You there!’ Stilgar roared. ‘Do as she says!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But, Stil—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained piece of lizard turd! Do it or I’ll help her dismember you! Can’t you
         see the worth of this woman?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment, lowered his weapon.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He has obeyed,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Now,’ Jessica said, ‘explain clearly to your people what it is you wish of me. I want no young hothead to make a foolish
         mistake.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘When we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin, blend with the pan and graben folk,’ Stilgar said. ‘We
         carry no weapons, for the crysknife is sacred. But you, woman, you have the weirding ability of battle. We’d only heard of
         it and many doubted, but one cannot doubt what he sees with his own eyes. You mastered an armed Fremen. <em>This</em> is a weapon no search could expose.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was a stirring in the basin as Stilgar’s words sank home.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And if I agree to teach you the … weirding way?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My countenance for you as well as your son.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar’s voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning, took on an edge of bitterness. ‘Out here, woman, we carry
         no paper for contracts. We make no evening promises to be broken at dawn. When a man says a thing, that’s the contract. As
         leader of my people, I’ve put them in bond to my word. Teach us this weirding way and you have sanctuary with us as long as
         you wish. Your water shall mingle with our water.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Can you speak for all Fremen?’Jessica asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘In time, that may be. But only my brother, Liet, speaks for all Fremen. Here, I promise only secrecy. My people will not
         speak of you to any other sietch. The Harkonnens have returned to <a id="page319"/>Dune in force and your Duke is dead. It is said that you two died in a Mother storm. The hunter does not seek dead game.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>There’s safety in that,</em> Jessica thought. <em>But these people have good communications and a message could be sent.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I presume there was a reward offered for us,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar remained silent, and she could almost see the thoughts turning over in his head, sensing the shifts of his muscles
         beneath her hands.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, he said: ‘I will say it once more: I’ve given the tribe’s word-bond. My people know your worth to us now. What
         could the Harkonnens give us? Our freedom? Hah! No, you are the taqwa, that which buys us more than all the spice in the Harkonnen
         coffers.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then I shall teach you my way of battle,’Jessica said, and she sensed the unconscious ritual-intensity of her own words.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Now, you will release me?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘So be it,’Jessica said. She released her hold on him, stepped aside in full view of the band in the basin. <em>This is the test-mashad,</em> she thought. <em>But Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the waiting silence, Paul inched forward to get a better view of where his mother stood. As he moved, he heard heavy breathing,
         suddenly stilled, above him in the vertical crack of the rock, and sensed a faint shadow there outlined against the stars.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar’s voice came up from the basin: ‘You, up there! Stop hunting the boy. He’ll come down presently.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice of a young boy or girl sounded from the darkness above Paul: ‘But, Stil, he can’t be far from—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I said leave him be, Chani! You spawn of a lizard!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">There came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: ‘Call <em>me</em> spawn of a lizard!’ But the shadow pulled back out of view.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray-shadowed movement of Stilgar beside his mother.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Come in, all of you,’ Stilgar called. He turned to Jessica. ‘And now I’ll ask you how <em>we</em> may be certain you’ll fulfill your half of our bargain? You’re the one’s lived with papers and empty contracts and such as—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page320"/>‘We of the Bene Gesserit don’t break our vows any more than you do,’Jessica said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: ‘A Bene Gesserit witch!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul brought his captured weapon from his sash, trained it on the dark figure of Stilgar, but the man and his companions remained
         immobile, staring at Jessica.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It <em>is</em> the legend,’ someone said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It was said that the Shadout Mapes gave this report on you,’ Stilgar said. ‘But a thing so important must be tested. If you
         are the Bene Gesserit of the legend whose son will lead us to paradise …’ He shrugged.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica sighed, thinking: <em>So our Missionaria Protectiva even planted religious safety valves all through this hell hole. Ah, well … it’ll help, and
            that’s what it was meant to do.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She said: ‘The seeress who brought you the legend, she gave it under the binding of karama and ijaz, the miracle and the inimitability
         of the prophecy – this I know. Do you wish to see a sign?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">His nostrils flared in the moonlight. ‘We cannot tarry for the rites,’ he whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency escape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been
         a place called ‘Sietch Tabr’ on the chart and beside it the notation: ‘Stilgar.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: <em>If only he knew the tricks we use! She must’ve been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva. These Fremen are
            beautifully prepared to believe in us.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar shifted uneasily. ‘We must go now.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul crouched. ‘You there, lad: you may come down now.’
         He returned his attention to Jessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: ‘Your son made an incredible amount of noise climbing.
         He has much to learn lest he endanger us all, but he’s young.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page321"/>‘No doubt we have much to teach each other,’ Jessica said. ‘Meanwhile, you’d best see to your companion out there. My noisy
         son was a bit rough in disarming him.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar whirled, his hood flapping. ‘Where?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Beyond those bushes.’ She pointed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar touched two of his men. ‘See to it.’ He glanced at his companions, identifying them. Jamis is missing.’ He turned
         to Jessica. ‘Even your cub knows the weirding way.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And you’ll notice that my son hasn’t stirred from up there as you ordered,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and gasped between them. Stilgar gave them a flicking
         glance, returned his attention to Jessica. ‘The son will take only your orders, eh? Good. He knows discipline.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Paul, you may come down now,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped the Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned,
         another figure arose from the rocks to face him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul saw a small figure in Fremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him
         from the hood, and the muzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am Chani, daughter of Liet.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I would not have permitted you to harm my companions,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon’s path and he saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity
         of that face, the features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to stillness. He remembered
         the angry bravado with which he had once described this face-from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam:
         ‘I will meet her.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You were as noisy as shai-hulud in a rage,’ she said. And you took the most difficult way up here. Follow me; I’ll show you
         an easier way down.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page322"/>He scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a tumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing
         over the rocks. Paul felt hot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>That girl!</em> She was like a touch of destiny. He felt caught up on a wave, in tune with a motion that lifted all his spirits.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They stood presently amid the Fremen on the basin floor.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: ‘This will be a good exchange of teachings. I hope you and your
         people feel no anger at our violence. It seemed … necessary. You were about to … make a mistake.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise,’ Stilgar said. He touched his lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon
         from Paul’s waist with the other, tossed it to a companion. ‘You will have your own maula pistol, lad, when you’ve earned
         it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mother’s teaching: <em>‘Beginnings are such delicate times.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My son has what weapons he needs,’Jessica said. She stared at Stilgar, forcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the
         pistol.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued – Jamis. The man stood at one side, head lowered, breathing heavily. ‘You are
         a difficult woman,’ Stilgar said. He held out his left hand to a companion, snapped his fingers. ‘Kushti bakka te.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>More Chakobsa,</em> Jessica thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgar’s hand. Stilgar ran them through his fingers, fixed one around Jessica’s
         neck beneath her hood, fitted the other around Paul’s neck in the same way.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka,’ he said. ‘If we become separated, you will be recognized as belonging to Stilgar’s
         sietch. We will talk of weapons another time.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul’s Fremkit pack to one of his men to carry.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Bakka,</em> Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: <em>bakka – the weeper.</em> She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. <em>Why should weeping unite them?</em> she asked herself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page323"/>Stilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: ‘Chani, take the child-man under your wing. Keep him out of
         trouble.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Chani touched Paul’s arm. ‘Come along, child-man.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul hid the anger in his voice, said: ‘My name is Paul. It were well you—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ll give you a name, manling,’ Stilgar said, ‘in the time of the mihna, at the test of aql.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The test of reason,</em> Jessica translated. The sudden need of Paul’s ascendancy overrode all other consideration, and she barked, ‘My son’s been
         tested with the gom jabbar!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s much we don’t know of each other,’ Stilgar said. ‘But we tarry overlong. Day-sun mustn’t find us in the open.’ He
         crossed to the man Paul had struck down, said, ‘Jamis, can you travel?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A grunt answered him. ‘Surprised me, he did. ’Twas an accident. I can travel.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No accident,’ Stilgar said. ‘I’ll hold you responsible with Chani for the lad’s safety, Jamis. These people have my countenance.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had argued with Stilgar from the rocks. His was the voice with death
         in it. And Stilgar had seen fit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out. ‘Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See
         that we leave no trace. Extra care – we have two with us who’ve not been trained.’ He turned, hand upheld and aimed across
         the basin. ‘In squad line with flankers – move out. ‘We must be at Cave of the Ridges before dawn.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads. There were forty Fremen – she and Paul made it forty-two. And she thought:
         <em>They travel as a military company – even the girl, Chani.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul took a place in the line behind Chani. He had put down the black feeling at being caught by a girl. In his mind now was
         the memory called up by his mother’s barked reminder: ‘My <a id="page324"/>son’s been tested with the gom jabbar!’ He found that his hand tingled with remembered pain.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Watch where you go,’ Chani hissed. ‘Do not brush against a bush lest you leave a thread to show our passage.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul swallowed, nodded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps and Paul’s, marveling at the way the Fremen moved.
         They were forty people crossing the basin with only the sounds natural to the place – ghostly feluccas, their robes flitting
         through the shadows. Their destination was Sietch Tabr – Stilgar’s sietch.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She turned the word over in her mind: sietch. It was a Chakobsa word, unchanged from the old hunting language of countless
         centuries. Sietch: a meeting place in time of danger. The profound implications of the word and the language were just beginning
         to register with her after the tension of their encounter.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We move well,’ Stilgar said. With Shai-hulud’s favor, we’ll reach Cave of the Ridges before dawn.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she held at bay by force of will … and, she admitted
         it: by the force of elation. Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed here about the Fremen culture.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>All of them,</em> she thought, <em>an entire culture trained to military order. What a priceless thing is here for an outcast Duke!</em></p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <p class="noindent">The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called ‘spannungsbogen’ – which is the self-imposed delay between desire
            for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.
         </p>
         <p class="right">—from ‘The Wisdom of Muad’Dib’ by the Princess Irulan</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">They approached Cave of the Ridges at dawnbreak, moving through a split in the basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways
         to negotiate it. Jessica saw Stilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight, saw them for a moment as they began their scrambling
         climb up the cliff.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry <a id="page325"/>of this planet cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward gray-blue sky.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Chani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: ‘Quickly. It is already light.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The men who climbed above us, where are they going?’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The first daywatch,’ she said. ‘Hurry now!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A guard left outside,</em> Paul thought. <em>Wise. But it would’ve been wiser still for us to approach this place in separate bands. Less chance of losing the whole troop.</em> He paused in the thought, realizing that this was guerrilla thinking, and he remembered his father’s fear that the Atreides
         might become a guerrilla house.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Faster,’ Chani whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind. And he thought of the words of the sirat from Yueh’s tiny O.C. Bible.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind.’</em> He rolled the quotation in his mind.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They rounded a corner where the passage widened. Stilgar stood at one side motioning them into a low hole that opened at right
         angles.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Quickly!’ he hissed. ‘We’re like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us here.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by thin gray light from somewhere ahead.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You can stand up,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling that curved away just out of a man’s handreach.
         The troop spread out through shadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one side, saw her examine their companions. And he noted
         how she failed to blend with the Fremen even though her garb was identical. The way she moved – such a sense of power and
         grace.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Find a place to rest and stay out of the way, child-man,’ Chani said. ‘Here’s food.’ She pressed two leaf-wrapped morsels
         into his hand. They reeked of spice.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar came up behind Jessica, called an order to a group on the left. ‘Get the doorseal in place and see to moisture security.’
         He turned to another Fremen: ‘Lemil, get glowglobes.’ He took <a id="page326"/>Jessica’s arm. ‘I wish to show you something, weirding woman.’ He led her around a curve of rock toward the light source.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening to the cave, an opening high in a cliff wall – looking
         out across another basin about ten or twelve kilometers wide. The basin was shielded by high rock walls. Sparse clumps of
         plant growth were scattered around it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">As she looked at the dawn-gray basin, the sun lifted over the far escarpment illuminating a biscuit-colored landscape of rocks
         and sand. And she noted how the sun of Arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It’s because we want to hold it back,</em> she thought. <em>Night is safer than day.</em> There came over her then a longing for a rainbow in this place that would never see rain. <em>I must suppress such longings,</em> she thought. <em>They’re a weakness. I no longer can afford weaknesses.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar gripped her arm, pointed across the basin. ‘There! There you see proper Druses.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She looked where he pointed, saw movement: people on the basin floor scattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite
         cliffwall. In spite of the distance, their movements were plain in the clear air. She lifted her binoculars from beneath her
         robe, focused the oil lenses on the distant people. Kerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored butterflies.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That is home,’ Stilgar said. ‘We will be there this night.’ He stared across the basin, tugging at his mustache. ‘My people
         stayed out overlate working. That means there are no patrols about. I’ll signal them later and they’ll prepare for us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your people show good discipline,’Jessica said. She lowered the binoculars, saw that Stilgar was looking at them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They obey the preservation of the tribe,’ he said. ‘It is the way we choose among us for a leader. The leader is the one
         who is the strongest, the one who brings water and security.’ He lifted his attention to her face.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyepits, the dust-rimmed beard and mustache, the line of the
         catchtube curving down from his nostrils into his stillsuit.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Have I compromised your leadership by besting you, Stilgar?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page327"/>‘You did not call me out,’ he said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s important that a leader keep the respect of his troop,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Isn’t a one of those sandlice I cannot handle,’ Stilgar said. ‘When you bested me, you bested us all. Now, they hope to learn
         from you … the weirding way … and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She weighed the implications. ‘By besting you in formal battle?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He nodded. ‘I’d advise you against this because they’d not follow you. You’re not of the sand. They saw this in our night’s
         passage.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Practical people,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘True enough.’ He glanced at the basin. ‘We know our needs. But not many are thinking deep thoughts now this close to home.
         We’ve been out overlong arranging to deliver our spice quota to the free traders for the cursed Guild … may their faces be
         forever black.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica stopped in the act of turning away from him, looked back up into his face. ‘The Guild? What has the Guild to do with
         your spice?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s Liet’s command,’ Stilgar said. ‘We know the reason, but the taste of it sours us. We bribe the Guild with a monstrous
         payment in spice to keep our skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of Arrakis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She weighed out her words, remembering that Paul had said this must be the reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites.
         ‘And what is it you do to the face of Arrakis that must not be seen?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We change it … slowly but with certainty … to make it fit for human life. Our generation will not see it, nor our children
         nor our children’s children nor the grandchildren of their children … but it will come.’ He stared with veiled eyes out over
         the basin. ‘Open water and tall green plants and people walking freely without stillsuits.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>So that’s the dream of this Liet-Kynes,</em> she thought. And she said: ‘Bribes are dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page328"/>‘They grow,’ he said, ‘but the slow way is the safe way.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica turned, looked out over the basin, trying to see it the way Stilgar was seeing it in his imagination. She saw only
         the grayed mustard stain of distant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliffs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h-h-h,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle, then realized it was a mirage – another landscape hovering over the desert-sand
         and a distant wavering of greenery and in the middle distance a long worm traveling the surface with what looked like Fremen
         robes fluttering on its back.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The mirage faded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It would be better to ride,’ Stilgar said, ‘but we cannot permit a maker into this basin. Thus, we must walk again tonight.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Maker – their word for worm,</em> she thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She measured the import of his words, the statement that they could not <em>permit</em> a worm into this basin. She knew what she had seen in the mirage – Fremen riding on the back of a giant worm. It took heavy
         control not to betray her shock at the implications.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We must be getting back to the others,’ Stilgar said. ‘Else my people may suspect I dally with you. Some already are jealous
         that my hands tasted your loveliness when we struggled last night in Tuono Basin.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That will be enough of that!’Jessica snapped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No offense,’ Stilgar said, and his voice was mild. ‘Women among us are not taken against their will … and with you …’ He
         shrugged. ‘… even that convention isn’t required.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You will keep in mind that I was a duke’s lady,’ she said, but her voice was calmer.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As you wish,’ he said. ‘It’s time to seal off this opening, to permit relaxation of stillsuit discipline. My people need
         to rest in comfort this day. Their families will give them little rest on the morrow.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Silence fell between them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica stared out into the sunlight. She had heard what she had heard in Stilgar’s voice – the unspoken offer of more than
         his <em>countenance.</em> Did he need a wife? She realized she could step <a id="page329"/>into that place with him. It would be one way to end conflict over tribal leadership – female properly aligned with male.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">But what of Paul then? Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed here? And what of the unborn daughter she had
         carried these few weeks? What of a dead Duke’s daughter? And she permitted herself to face fully the significance of this
         other child growing within her, to see her own motives in permitting the conception. She knew what it was – she had succumbed
         to that profound drive shared by all creatures who are faced with death – the drive to seek immortality through progeny. The
         fertility drive of the species had overpowered them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica glanced at Stilgar, saw that he was studying her, waiting. <em>A daughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this man – what would be the fate of such a daughter?</em> she asked herself. <em>Would he try to limit the necessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the questions in her mind. What is important for a
         leader is that which makes him a leader. It is the needs of his people. If you teach me your powers, there may come a day
         when one of us must challenge the other. I would prefer some alternative.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There are several alternatives?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Sayyadina,’ he said. ‘Our Reverend Mother is old.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Their Reverend Mother!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Before she could probe this, he said: ‘I do not necessarily offer myself as mate. This is nothing personal, for you are beautiful
         and desirable. But should you become one of my women, that might lead some of my young men to believe that I’m too much concerned
         with pleasures of the flesh and not enough concerned with the tribe’s needs. Even now they listen to us and watch us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences,</em> she thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild spirits,’ he said. ‘They must be eased through this period.
         I must leave no great reasons around for them to challenge me. Because I would have to maim and kill among them. This is not
         the proper course for a leader if it can be <a id="page330"/>avoided with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level
         of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">His words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to her as to those who secretly listened, forced her
         to re-evaluate him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He has stature,</em> she thought. <em>Where did he learn such inner balance?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The law that demands our form of choosing a leader is a just law,’ Stilgar said. ‘But it does not follow that justice is
         always the thing a people needs. What we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over more land.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>What is his ancestry?</em> she wondered. <em>Whence comes such breeding?</em> She said: ‘Stilgar, I underestimated you.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Such was my suspicion,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Each of us apparently underestimated the other,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I should like an end to this,’ he said. ‘I should like friendship with you … and trust. I should like that respect for each
         other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you trust me?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I hear your sincerity.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Among us,’ he said, ‘the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders, hold a special place of honor. They teach. They
         maintain the strength of God here.’ He touched his breast.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Now I must probe this Reverend Mother mystery,</em> she thought. And she said: ‘You spoke of your Reverend Mother … and I’ve heard words of legend and prophecy.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is said that a Bene Gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our future,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you believe I am that one?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She watched his face, thinking: <em>The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings are times of such great peril.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We do not know,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She nodded, thinking: <em>He’s an honorable man. He wants a sign from me, but he’ll not tip fate by telling me the sign.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica turned her head, stared down into the basin at the golden shadows, the purple shadows, the vibrations of dust-mote
         <a id="page331"/>air across the lip of their cave. Her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence. She knew the cant of the Missionaria
         Protectiva, knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear and hope to her emergency needs, but she sensed wild changes
         here … as though someone had been in among these Fremen and capitalized on the Missionaria Protectiva’s imprint.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar cleared his throat.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She sensed his impatience, knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to seal off this opening. This was a time for boldness
         on her part, and she realized what she needed: some dar al-hikman, some school of translation that would give her …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Adab,’ she whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Her mind felt as though it had rolled over within her. She recognized the sensation with a quickening of pulse. Nothing in
         all the Bene Gesserit training carried such a signal of recognition. It could be only the adab, the demanding memory that
         comes upon you of itself. She gave herself up to it, allowing the words to flow from her.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ibn qirtaiba,’ she said, ‘as far as the spot where the dust ends.’ She stretched out an arm from her robe, seeing Stilgar’s
         eyes go wide. She heard a rustling of many robes in the background. ‘I see a … Fremen with the book of examples,’ she intoned.
         ‘He reads to al-Lat, the sun whom he defied and subjugated. He reads to the Sadus of the Trial and this is what he reads:

      <blockquote class="linegroup">

         <p class="line">That did stand in the path of the tempest.</p>
         
         <p class="line">Hast thou not seen what our Lord did?</p>

         <p class="line">Their schemes are like pellets of poison</p>
         
         <p class="line">That every mouth rejects.’</p>
         
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="indent">A trembling passed through her. She dropped her arm.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Back to her from the inner cave’s shadows came a whispered response of many voices: ‘Their works have been overturned.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page332"/>‘The fire of God mount over thy heart,’ she said. And she thought: <em>Now, it goes in the proper channel.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The fire of God set alight,’ came the response.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She nodded. ‘Thine enemies shall fall,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Bi-lal kaifa,’ they answered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the sudden hush, Stilgar bowed to her. ‘Sayyadina,’ he said. ‘If the Shai-hulud grant, then you may yet pass within to
         become a Reverend Mother.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Pass within,</em> she thought. <em>An odd way of putting it. But the rest of it fitted into the cant well enough.</em> And she felt a cynical bitterness at what she had done. <em>Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails. A place was prepared for us in this wilderness. The prayer of the salat has carved
            out our hiding place. Now … I must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God … Sayyadina to rogue peoples who’ve been so
            heavily imprinted with our Bene Gesserit soothsay they even call their chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stood beside Chani in the shadows of the inner cave. He could still taste the morsel she had fed him – bird flesh and
         grain bound with spice honey and encased in a leaf. In tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten such a concentration
         of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear. He knew what this essence could do to him – the <em>spice change</em> that pushed his mind into prescient awareness.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Bi-lal kaifa,’ Chani whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked at her, seeing the awe with which the Fremen appeared to accept his mother’s words. Only the man called Jamis seemed
         to stand aloof from the ceremony, holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Duy yakha hin mange,’ Chani whispered. ‘Duy punra hin mange. I have two eyes. I have two feet.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And she stared at Paul with a look of wonder.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul took a deep breath, trying to still the tempest within him. His mother’s words had locked onto the working of the spice
         essence, and he had felt her voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire. Through it all, he had sensed
         the edge of cynicism in her – he knew her so well! – but nothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Terrible purpose!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page333"/>He sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escape. There was the sharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold
         precision of his awareness. He sank to the floor, sitting with his back against rock, giving himself up to it. Awareness flowed
         into that timeless stratum where he could view time, sensing the available paths, the winds of the future … the winds of the
         past: the one-eyed vision of the future – all combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to see time-become-space.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was danger, he felt, of overrunning himself, and he had to hold onto his awareness of the present, sensing the blurred
         deflection of experience, the flowing moment, the continual solidification of that-which-is into the perpetual-was.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness of time’s movement everywhere complicated by shifting
         currents, waves, surges, and countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs. It gave him a new understanding of his prescience,
         and he saw the source of blind time, the source of error in it, with an immediate sensation of fear.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the limits of what it revealed – at once a source of accuracy
         and meaningful error. A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw,
         changed what he saw.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And what he saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action
         – the wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand – moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw
         violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The countless consequences – lines fanned out from this cave, and along most of these consequence-lines he saw his own dead
         body with blood flowing from a gaping knife wound.

      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">Jessica awakened in cave darkness, sensing the stir of Fremen around her, smelling the acrid stillsuit odor. Her inner timesense
         told her it would soon be night outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded from the desert by the plastic hoods
         that trapped their body moisture within this space.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue, and this suggested something of her
         own unconscious assessment on personal security within Stilgar’s troop. She turned in the hammock that had been fashioned
         of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her desert boots.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I must remember to fasten the boots slip-fashion to help my stillsuit’s pumping action,</em> she thought. <em>There are so many things to remember.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She could still taste their morning meal – the morsel of bird flesh and grain bound within a leaf with spice honey – and it
         came to her that the use of time was turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of rest.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Night conceals; night is safest.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove, fumbled with the fabric in the dark until she found the top,
         slipped into it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">How to get a message out to the Bene Gesserit? she <a id="page335"/>wondered. They would have to be told of the two strays in Arrakeen sanctuary.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Glowglobes came alight farther into the cave. She saw people moving there, Paul among them already dressed and with his hood
         thrown back to reveal the aquiline Atreides profile.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He had acted so strangely before they retired, she thought. <em>Withdrawn.</em> He was like one come back from the dead, not yet fully aware of his return, his eyes half shut and glassy with the inward
         stare. It made her think of his warning about the spice-impregnated diet: <em>addictive.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Are there side effects?</em> she wondered. <em>He said it had something to do with his prescient faculty, but he has been strangely silent about what he sees.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the glowglobes. She marked how he fingered his beard
         and the watchful, cat-stalking look of him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Abrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions visible in the people gathered around Paul – the stiff
         movements, the ritual positions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They have my countenance!’ Stilgar rumbled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted – Jamis! She saw then the rage in Jamis – the tight set of his shoulders.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Jamis, the man Paul bested!</em> she thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You know the rule, Stilgar,’Jamis said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who knows it better?’ Stilgar asked, and she heard the tone of placation in his voice, the attempt to smooth something over.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I choose the combat,’Jamis growled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica sped across the cave, grasped Stilgar’s arm. ‘What is this?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is the amtal rule,’ Stilgar said. Jamis is demanding the right to test your part in the legend.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘She must be championed,’Jamis said. ‘If her champion wins, that’s the truth in it. But it’s said …’ He glanced across the
         press of people. ‘… that she’d need no champion from the Fremen – which can mean only that she brings her own champion.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He’s talking of single combat with Paul!</em> Jessica thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She released Stilgar’s arm, took a half-step forward. ‘I’m <a id="page336"/>always my own champion,’ she said. ‘The meaning’s simple enough for …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’ll not tell us our ways!’ Jamis snapped. ‘Not without more proof than I’ve seen. Stilgar could’ve told you what to say
         last morning. He could’ve filled your mind full of the coddle and you could’ve bird-talked it to us, hoping to make a false
         way among us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I can take him,</em> Jessica thought, <em>but that might conflict with the way they interpret the legend.</em> And again she wondered at the way the Missionaria Protectiva’s work had been twisted on this planet.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar looked at Jessica, spoke in a low voice but one designed to carry to the crowd’s fringe. Jamis is one to hold a grudge,
         Sayyadina. Your son bested him and—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It was an accident!’Jamis roared. ‘There was witch-force at Tuono Basin and I’ll prove it now!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘… and I’ve bested him myself,’ Stilgar continued. ‘He seeks by this tahaddi challenge to get back at me as well. There’s
         too much of violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader – too much ghafla, the distraction. He gives his mouth to
         the rules and his heart to the sarfa, the turning away. No, he could never make a good leader. I’ve preserved him this long
         because he’s useful in a fight as such, but when he gets this carving anger on him he’s dangerous to his own society.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Stilgar-r-r-r!’Jamis rumbled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Jessica saw what Stilgar was doing, trying to enrage Jamis, to take the challenge away from Paul.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar faced Jamis, and again Jessica heard the soothing in the rumbling voice. Jamis, he’s but a boy. He’s—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You named him a man,’ Jamis said. ‘His mother <em>says</em> he’s been through the gom jabbar. He’s full-fleshed and with a surfeit of water. The ones who carried their pack say there’s
         literjons of water in it. Literjons! And us sipping our catchpockets the instant they show dewsparkle.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar glanced at Jessica. ‘Is this true? Is there water in your pack?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Literjons of it?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Two literjons.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page337"/>‘What was intended with this wealth?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Wealth?</em> she thought. She shook her head, feeling the coldness in his voice.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Where I was born, water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide rivers,’ she said. ‘There were oceans of it so broad
         you could not see the other shore. I’ve not been trained to your water discipline. I never before had to think of it this
         way.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A sighing gasp arose from the people around them: ‘Water fell from the sky … it ran <em>over</em> the land.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Did you know there’re those among us who’ve lost from their catchpockets by accident and will be in sore trouble before we
         reach Tabr this night?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘How could I know?’ Jessica shook her head. ‘If they’re in need, give them water from our pack.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is that what you intended with this wealth?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I intended it to save life,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’ll not buy us off with water,’ Jamis growled. ‘Nor will you anger me against yourself, Stilgar. I see you trying to make
         me call you out before I’ve proved my words.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar faced Jamis. ‘Are you determined to press this fight against a child, Jamis?’ His voice was low, venomous.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘She must be championed.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Even though she has my countenance?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I invoke the amtal rule,’Jamis said. ‘It’s my right.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar nodded. ‘Then, if the boy does not carve you down, you’ll answer to my knife afterward. And this time I’ll not hold
         back the blade as I’ve done before.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You cannot do this thing,’Jessica said. ‘Paul’s just—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You must not interfere, Sayyadina,’ Stilgar said. ‘Oh, I know you can take me and, therefore, can take anyone among us, but
         you cannot best us all united. This must be; it is the amtal rule.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica fell silent, staring at him in the green light of the glowglobes, seeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over
         his expression. She shifted her attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to his brows and thought: <em>I should’ve seen that before. He broods. He’s the silent kind, one who works himself up inside. I should’ve been prepared.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page338"/>‘If you harm my son,’ she said, ‘You’ll have me to meet. I call you out now. I’ll carve you into a joint of—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mother.’ Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. ‘Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Explain!’Jamis sneered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul fell silent, staring at the man. He felt no fear of him. Jamis appeared clumsy in his movements and he had fallen so
         easily in their night encounter on the sand. But Paul still felt the nexus-boiling of this cave, still remembered the prescient
         visions of himself dead under a knife. There had been so few avenues of escape for him in that vision …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar said: ‘Sayyadina, you must step back now where—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Stop calling her Sayyadina!’ Jamis said. ‘That’s yet to be proved. So she knows the prayer! What’s that? Every child among
         us knows it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He has talked enough,</em> Jessica thought. <em>I’ve the key to him. I could immobilize him with a word.</em> She hesitated. <em>But I cannot stop them all.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You will answer to me then,’Jessica said, and she pitched her voice in a twisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch
         at the end.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis stared at her, fright visible on his face.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll teach you agony,’ she said in the same tone. ‘Remember <em>that</em> as you fight. You’ll have agony such as will make the gom jabbar a happy memory by comparison. You will writhe with your
         entire—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘She tries a spell on me!’Jamis gasped. He put his clenched right fist beside his ear. ‘I invoke the silence on her!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘So be it then,’ Stilgar said. He cast a warning glance at Jessica. ‘If you speak again, Sayyadina, we’ll know it’s your witchcraft
         and you’ll be forfeit.’ He nodded for her to step back.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica felt hands pulling her, helping her back, and she sensed they were not unkindly. She saw Paul being separated from
         the throng, the elfin-faced Chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A ring formed within the troop. More glowglobes were brought and all of them tuned to the yellow band.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to someone in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy gray
         <a id="page339"/>slickness of stillsuit that was patched and marked by tucks and gathers. For a moment, he bent with his mouth to his shoulder,
         drinking from a catchpocket tube. Presently he straightened, peeled off and detached the suit, handed it carefully into the
         crowd. He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet, a crysknife in his right hand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw the girl-child Chani helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife handle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the
         weight and balance. And it came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu, the nerve and the fiber – that he
         had been taught fighting in a deadly school, his teachers men like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were legends in
         their own lifetimes. The boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked supple and confident.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>But he’s only fifteen,</em> she thought. <em>And he has no shield. I must stop this. Somehow, there must be a way to …</em> She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You cannot stop it,’ he said. ‘You must not speak.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She put a hand over her mouth, thinking: <em>I’ve planted fear in Jamis’ mind. It’ll slow him some … perhaps. If I could only pray – truly pray.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stood alone now just into the ring, clad in the fighting trunks he’d worn under his stillsuit. He held a crysknife in
         his right hand; his feet were bare against the sand-gritted rock. Idaho had warned him time and again: <em>‘When in doubt of your surface, bare feet are best.’</em> And there were Chani’s words of instruction still in the front of his consciousness: <em>‘Jamis turns to the right with his knife after a parry. It’s a habit we’ve all seen. And he’ll aim for the eyes to catch a
            blink in which to slash you. And he can fight either hand; look out for a knife shift.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">But the strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was the training and the instinctual reaction mechanism
         that had been hammered into him day after day, hour after hour on the practice floor.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Gurney Halleck’s words were there to remember: ‘<em>The good knife fighter thinks on point and blade and shearing-guard simultaneously. The point can also cut; the blade can
            also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent’s blade.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page340"/>Paul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to
         protect the hand. And even so, he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not even know if it
         <em>could be</em> broken.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul crouched, realizing then that he had no shield, but was trained to fighting with its subtle field around him, trained
         to react on defense with utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness necessary for penetrating
         the enemy’s shield. In spite of constant warning from his trainers not to depend on the shield’s mindless blunting of attack
         speed, he knew that shield-awareness was part of him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis called out in ritual challenge: ‘May thy knife chip and shatter!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>This knife will break then,</em> Paul thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He cautioned himself that Jamis also was without shield, but the man wasn’t trained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared across the ring at Jamis. The man’s body looked like knotted whipcord on a dried skeleton. His crysknife shone
         milky yellow in the light of the glowglobes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Fear coursed through Paul. He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull yellow light within this ring of people. Prescience
         had fed his knowledge with countless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the strings of decision
         that guided them, but this was the <em>real-now.</em> This was death hanging on an infinite number of minuscule mischances.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Anything could tip the future here, he realized. Someone coughing in the troop of watchers, a distraction. A variation in
         a glowglobe’s brilliance, a deceptive shadow.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I’m afraid,</em> Paul told himself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating to himself the Bene Gesserit litany against fear. <em>‘Fear is the mind-killer</em> …’It was a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles unite themselves, become poised and ready.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page341"/>‘I’ll sheathe my knife in your blood,’Jamis snarled. And in the middle of the last word, he pounced.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Where the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Now, Paul! Now!Jessica</em> screamed it in her mind.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul’s motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave Jamis the margin to twist away, backing and turning
         to the right.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul withdrew, crouching low. ‘First, you must find my blood,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica recognized the shield-fighter timing in her son, and it came over her what a two-edged thing that was. The boy’s reactions
         were those of youth and trained to a peak these people had never seen. But the attack was trained, too, and conditioned by
         the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier. A shield would repel too fast a blow, admit only the slowly deceptive counter.
         It needed control and trickery to get through a shield.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Does Paul see it?</em> she asked herself. <em>He must!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under the glowglobes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And again.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And again.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Each time, Paul’s counterblow came an instant late.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see. Paul’s defensive reactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each
         time at the precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis’ blow.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is your son playing with that poor fool?’ Stilgar asked. He waved her to silence before she could respond. ‘Sorry; you must
         remain silent.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Now the two figures on the rock floor circled each other: Jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul
         crouched with knife held low.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had been dodging.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page342"/>Instead of faking back and out, Paul met the man’s knife hand on the point of his own blade. Then the boy was gone, twisting
         away to the left and thankful for Chani’s warning.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand. Blood dripped from the injury for a moment, stopped. His
         eyes were wide and staring – two blue-black holes – studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah, that one hurt,’ Stilgar murmured.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first blood, called out: ‘Do you yield?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hah!’Jamis cried.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">An angry murmur arose from the troop.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hold!’ Stilgar called out. ‘The lad doesn’t know our rule.’ Then, to Paul: ‘There can be no yielding in the tahaddi challenge.
         Death is the test of it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought: <em>He’s never killed a man like this … in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis’ movement. The prescient knowledge of the time-boiling variables in this cave came
         back to plague him now. His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed decisions in this fight for
         any clear channel ahead to show itself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Variable piled on variable – that was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in his path. It was like a gigantic rock in the
         flood, creating maelstroms in the current around it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Have an end to it, lad,’ Stilgar muttered. ‘Don’t play with him.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis backed now that the realization swept over him – that this was no soft offworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for
         a Fremen crysknife.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw the shadow of desperation in the man’s face. <em>Now is when he’s most dangerous,</em> she thought. <em>Now he’s desperate and can do anything. He sees that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born
            and trained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page343"/>And she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis – an emotion tempered by awareness of the immediate peril to her son.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Jamis could do anything … any unpredictable thing,</em> she told herself. She wondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if he were reliving this experience. But she saw the
         way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles.
         And for the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in Paul’s gift.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear in his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho’s voice
         flowed through Paul’s awareness: <em>‘When your opponent fears you, then’s the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let
            it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment,
            but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes
            and use them.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The crowd in the cavern began to mutter.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They think Paul’s toying with Jamis,</em> Jessica thought. <em>They think Paul’s being needlessly cruel.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">But she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their enjoyment of the spectacle. And she could see the pressure
         building up in Jamis. The moment when it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to Jamis … or
         to Paul.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but the hand was empty. The crysknife had been shifted
         to his left hand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica gasped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Paul had been warned by Chani: <em>‘Jamis fights with either hand.’</em> And the depth of his training had taken in that trick <em>en passant. ‘Keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it,’</em> Gurney Halleck had told him time and again. <em>‘The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either hand.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Paul had seen Jamis’ mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a heartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which
         had been intended to confuse Paul and hide the knife shift.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Except for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky <a id="page344"/>eyes of the staring troop, it was similar to a session on the practice floor. Shields didn’t count where the body’s own movement
         could be used against it. Paul shifted his own knife in a blurred motion, slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis’
         chest was descending – then away to watch the man crumple.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face toward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor. His
         dead eyes stared out like beads of dark glass.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Killing with the point lacks artistry,’</em> Idaho had once told Paul, <em>‘but don’t let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside. They hid Jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity. Presently
         a group of them hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And there was no body on the rock floor.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a sea of robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Now is the terrible moment,</em> she thought. <em>He has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space where two bearded Fremen were helping Paul into
         his stillsuit.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica stared at her son. Paul’s eyes were bright. He breathed heavily, permitting the ministrations to his body rather than
         helping them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Him against Jamis and not a mark on him,’ one of the men muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Chani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul. Jessica saw the girl’s excitement, the admiration in the elfin face.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It must be done now and swiftly,</em> Jessica thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: ‘We-l-l, now – how does it feel to be a killer?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother’s cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily
         he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar pressed through to Jessica’s side, returning from the <a id="page345"/>cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: ‘When the time comes for
         you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar’s sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people
         made – it served a purpose now. She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw. Admiration, yes,
         and fear … and in some – loathing. She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked at his mother. ‘You know what it was,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept her glance across the troop, said: ‘Paul has never
         killed a man with a naked blade.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I wasn’t playing with him,’ Paul said. He pressed in front of his mother, straightening his robe, glanced at the dark place
         of Jamis’ blood on the cavern floor. ‘I did not want to kill him.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She
         heard muttering awareness spread through the troop.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s why y’ asked him to yield,’ Stilgar said. ‘I see. Our ways are different, but you’ll see the sense in them. I thought
         we’d admitted a scorpion into our midst.’ He hesitated, then: ‘And I shall not call you lad the more.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A voice from the troop called out: ‘Needs a naming, Stil.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. ‘I see strength in you … like the strength beneath a pillar.’ Again he paused, then:
         ‘You shall be known among us as Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your troop name. We of Sietch Tabr
         may use it, but none other may so presume … Usul.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Murmuring went through the troop: ‘Good choice, that … strong … bring us luck.’ And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing
         she was included in it with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Now, what name of manhood <em>do you</em> choose for us to call you openly?’ Stilgar asked.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of <a id="page346"/>this moment registered on his prescient <em>memory,</em> but he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?’ Paul asked, remembering the <em>pop-hop</em> of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one hand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A chuckle sounded through the troop.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We call that one muad’dib,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen would accept them and call him thus. She felt a
         sudden fear <em>of her</em> son <em>and for</em> him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over countless times in his mind … yet … there were differences.
         He could see himself perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a profound store of knowledge,
         but all around him was abyss.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and
         burning across the universe in the name of their prophet Muad’Dib.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>That must not happen,</em> he told himself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is that the name you wish, Muad’Dib?’ Stilgar asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am an Atreides,’ Paul whispered, and then louder: ‘It’s not right that I give up entirely the name my father gave me. Could
         I be known among you as Paul-Muad’Dib?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You are Paul-Muad’Dib,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Paul thought: <em>That was in no vision of mine. I did a different thing.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">But he felt that the abyss remained all around him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man: ‘Wisdom with strength … Couldn’t ask more … It’s the
         legend for sure … Lisan al-Gaib … Lisan al-Gaib …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I will tell you a thing about your new name,’ Stilgar said. ‘The choice pleases us. Muad’Dib is wise in the ways of the desert.
         Muad’Dib creates his own water. Muad’Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad’Dib is fruitful and multiplies
         over the land. Muad’Dib we call “instructor-of-boys.” <a id="page347"/>That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad’Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar touched Paul’s forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced Paul and murmured, ‘Usul.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">As Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul, repeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from
         embrace to embrace through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone: ‘Usul … Usul … Usul.’ Already, he could place
         some of them by name. And there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: ‘Now you are of the Ichwan Bedwine, our brother.’ His face hardened,
         and he spoke with command in his voice. ‘And now, Paul-Muad’Dib, tighten up that stillsuit.’ He glanced at Chani. ‘Chani!
         Paul-Muad’Dib’s nose plugs are as poor a fit as I’ve ever seen! I thought I ordered you to see after him!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I hadn’t the makings, Stil,’ she said. ‘There’s Jamis’, of course, but—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Enough of that!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then I’ll share one of mine,’ she said. ‘I can make do with one until—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You will not,’ Stilgar said. ‘I know there are spares among us. Where are the spares? Are we a troop together or a band of
         savages?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar selected four, handed them to Chani. ‘Fit these to
         Usul and the Sayyadina.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A voice lifted from the back of the troop: ‘What of the water, Stil? What of the literjons in their pack?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I know your need, Farok,’ Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Broach one for those that need it,’ Stilgar said. ‘Water-master … where is a watermaster? Ah, Shimoom, care for the measuring
         of what is needed. The necessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and will be repaid in the
         sietch at field rates less pack fees.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What is this repayment at field rates?’Jessica asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page348"/>‘Ten for one,’ Stilgar said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s a wise rule as you’ll come to see,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. ‘As to Jamis,’ he said, ‘I order the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion
         and brother of the Ichwan Bedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved our fortune by his
         tahaddi challenge. I invoke the rite … at sunset, when the dark shall cover him.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the abyss … blind time. There was no past occupying
         the future in his mind … except … except … he could still sense the green and black Atreides banner waving … somewhere ahead
         … still see the jihad’s bloody swords and fanatic legions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It will not be,</em> he told himself. <em>I cannot let it be.</em></p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <p class="noindent">God created Arrakis to train the faithful.</p>
         <p class="right">—from ‘The Wisdom of Muad’Dib’ by the Princess Irulan</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">In the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as people moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar
         had said were the signals of his watchmen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave’s openings. She could see the march of evening shadows across
         the lip of rock in front of her and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in the dry heat
         as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these Fremen obviously had – the ability to
         sense even the slightest change in the air’s moisture.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">How they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Deep within the cave, someone began chanting:</p>
      
      <blockquote class="linegroup">
         <p class="line1">‘Ima trava okolo!</p>
         
         <p class="line1">I korenja okolo! <em>‘</em></p>
         
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page349"/>Jessica translated silently: <em>‘These are ashes!And these are roots!’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the sky. Night was beginning to utter its shadows along
         the distant rocks and the dunes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Yet the heat persisted.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Heat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole people could be trained to be thirsty only at given
         times.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Thirst.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks … and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze
         that fingered her robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new nose plugs irritated her, and she
         found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed down across her face into the suit, recovering her breath’s moisture.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The suit itself was a sweatbox.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Your suit will be more comfortable when you’ve adjusted to lower water content in your body,’</em> Stilgar had said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more comfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here
         weighed on her mind. <em>No,</em> she corrected herself: <em>it was preoccupation with</em> moisture.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And that was a more subtle and profound matter.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave’s depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>There’s another thing,</em> Jessica thought. <em>Paul must be cautioned about their women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine, yes, but
            not as wife.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then she wondered at herself, thinking: <em>Have I been infected with his schemes?</em> And she saw how well she had been conditioned. <em>I can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet … I was more than concubine.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mother.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mother, do you know what they’re doing back there?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page350"/>Jessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. ‘I think so.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Chani showed me … because I’m supposed to see it and give my … permission for the weighing of the water.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica looked at Chani.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’re recovering Jamis’ water,’ Chani said, and her thin voice came out nasal past the nose plugs. ‘It’s the rule. The
         flesh belongs to the person, but his water belongs to the tribe … except in the combat.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They say the water’s mine,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Combat water belongs to the winner,’ Chani said. ‘It’s because you have to fight in the open without stillsuits. The winner
         has to get his water back that he loses while fighting.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I don’t want his water,’ Paul muttered. He felt that he was a part of many images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting
         way that was disconcerting to the inner eye. He could not be certain what he would do, but of one thing he was positive: he
         did not want the water distilled out of Jamis’ flesh.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s … water,’ Chani said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica marveled at the way she said it. <em>‘Water.’</em> So much meaning in a simple sound. A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica’s mind: <em>‘Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.’</em> And Jessica thought: <em>Paul and I, we must find the currents and patterns in these strange waters … if we’re to survive.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You will accept the water,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She recognized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once with Leto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept
         a large sum offered for his support in a questionable venture – because money maintained power for the Atreides.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">On Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she ordered – not because she ordered it, but because her tone of voice
         had forced him to re-evaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh’s O.C. Bible. He said: ‘From water does all life begin.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page351"/>Jessica stared at him. <em>Where did he learn that quotation?</em> she asked herself. <em>He hasn’t studied the mysteries.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Thus it is spoken,’ Chani said. ‘Giudichar mantene: It is written in the Shah-Nama that water was the first of all things
         created.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">For no reason she could explain (and <em>this</em> bothered her more than the sensation), Jessica suddenly shuddered. She turned away to hide her confusion and was just in
         time to see the sunset. A violent calamity of color spilled over the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is time!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice was Stilgar’s ringing in the cavern. Jamis’ weapon has been killed. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud,
         who has ordained the phases for the moons that daily wane and – in the end – appear as bent and withered twigs.’ Stilgar’s
         voice lowered. ‘Thus it is with Jamis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Silence fell like a blanket on the cavern.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw the gray-shadow movement of Stilgar like a ghost figure within the inner reaches. She glanced at the basin, sensing
         the coolness.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The friends of Jamis will approach,’ Stilgar said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Men moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening. A single glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave.
         Its yellow glow picked out an inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the rustling of the robes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Chani took a step away as though pulled by the light.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica bent close to Paul’s ear, speaking in the family code: ‘Follow their lead; do as they do. It will be a simple ceremony
         to placate the shade of Jamis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It will be more than that,</em> Paul thought. And he felt a wrenching sensation within his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion
         and render it motionless.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Chani glided back to Jessica’s side, took her hand. ‘Come, Sayyadina. We must sit apart.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt abandoned.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Come, Usul.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page352"/>He allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of people being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath
         the glowglobe and beside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with the movement. Paul settled with them, watching
         Stilgar, noting the way the overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at his neck. Paul
         shifted his attention to the robe-covered mound at Stilgar’s feet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the
         fabric.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The spirit leaves the body’s water when the first moon rises,’ Stilgar intoned. ‘Thus it is spoken. When we see the first
         moon rise this night, whom will it summon?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Jamis,’ the troop responded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Stilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of faces. ‘I was a friend of Jamis,’ he said. ‘When
         the hawk plane stooped upon us at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. ‘I take this robe as a friend of Jamis – leader’s right.’ He draped
         the robe over a shoulder, straightening.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Now, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray of a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief
         with a small book in its center, the bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty sheath, a folded pack, a paracompass, a distrans,
         a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump
         of bundled feathers … and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>So Jamis played the baliset,</em> Paul thought. The instrument reminded him of Gurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul knew with his memory of the future
         in the past that some chance-lines could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the reunions were few and shadowed. They puzzled
         him. The uncertainty factor touched him with wonder. <em>Does it mean that something I will do … that I</em> may <em>do, could destroy Gurney … or bring him back to life … or …</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul swallowed, shook his head.</p>
