<p class="indent"><a id="page77"/>‘He’s in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,’Jessica said. ‘If you have trouble waking him, call
         on Dr Yueh in the next room. Paul may require a wakeshot.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica
         could ask about the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Hawat certified this place,</em> Jessica thought. <em>There can’t be anything too terrible in here.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>An air lock!</em> Jessica thought. She glanced down, saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat’s personal
         mark. <em>The door was left propped open,</em> she thought. <em>Someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She stepped over the lip into the little room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Why an airlock in a house?</em> she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in special climates.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Special climate!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">That would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing things had to be irrigated.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it open securely with the stick Hawat had left. Again,
         she faced the wheel-locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She recognized
         Galach words, read:
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God’s Creation; then, stand before it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme
         Friend.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred
         her hair. She felt change in the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow
         sunlight pouring across it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A yellow sun?</em> she asked herself. Then: <em>Filter glass!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A wet-planet conservatory,’ she breathed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page78"/>Potted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed
         pleniscenta, green and white striped akarso … roses …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Even roses!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to peer around the room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rhythmic noise invaded her senses.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of the room. A low fountain stood there, small with
         fluted lips. The rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a-gallop onto the metal bowl.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a methodical inspection of the room’s perimeter. It appeared
         to be about ten meters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle differences in construction, she
         guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original building’s completion.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass, stared around. Every available space
         in the room was crowded with exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then glimpsed a simple
         clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm
         retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Water everywhere in this room – on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously
         that it shocked her to inner stillness.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock
         uplifting known as the Shield Wall.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Filter glass,</em> she thought. <em>To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him
            to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn’t been time. And he’s been busy with more serious problems.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior
         moisture. Leto had said it was a deliberate statement of <a id="page79"/>power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent
         dust.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">But this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of water seals on outer doors. She estimated that this
         pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis – possibly more.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move brought into view a metallic surface at table
         height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf.
         She crossed to the table, noted Hawat’s day signs on it, studied a message written on the pad:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <p class="noindent">T<span class="small-caps">O THE</span> L<span class="small-caps">ADY JESSICA</span>—
         </p>
         <p class="noindent">May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the
            same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.
         </p>
         <p class="right">My kindest wishes. <br/>M<span class="small-caps">ARGOT</span> L<span class="small-caps">ADY</span> F<span class="small-caps">ENRING</span>’
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor’s former proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message
         of the note demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was another Bene Gesserit. A
         bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: <em>The Count married his Lady.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Even as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible
         note contained the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give another Bene Gesserit
         when conditions demanded it: ‘On that path lies danger.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots. Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking
         fingers. Nothing. She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.
      </p>
      
      
<p class="indent"><a id="page80"/><em>Something in the position of the pad?</em> she wondered.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed
         a finger along the under surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the subtle coded dots,
         scanned them in a single passage:
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your son and Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps
         to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection.’ Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the full message
         had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots: ‘I do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to
         do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as
         gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive that I cannot tell more. My sources are
         few as my Count is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through
         it, holding something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, pushed through the leaves to her,
         glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Paul!’ She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. ‘What is that?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: ‘Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but
         I want to be sure. Water should short it out.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Immerse it!’ she commanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He obeyed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, she said: ‘Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem,
         prodded the deadly sliver.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was dead.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes <a id="page81"/>studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized – the B.G. Way.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This place could conceal anything,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ve reason to believe it’s safe,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It was a hunter-seeker,’ she reminded him. ‘That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have
         limited range. The thing could’ve been spirited in here after Hawat’s investigation.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">But she thought of the message of the leaf: ‘… <em>defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.’ Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,’ he said. ‘That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Shadout Mapes,’ Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. ‘A summons from your father to—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That can wait,’ Paul said. ‘Why do you think this room’s safe?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She pointed to the note, explained about it.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He relaxed slightly.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: <em>A hunter-seeker! Merciful Mother!</em> It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul spoke matter-of-factly: ‘It’s the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have to destroy them.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A rapping sounded at the airlock door – the code knock of one of Hawat’s corps.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Come in,’ Paul called.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room. ‘There you are,
         sir,’ he said. ‘The housekeeper said you’d be here.’ He glanced around the room. ‘We found a cairn in the cellar and caught
         a man in it. He had a seeker console.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll want to take part in the interrogation,’ Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Nothing to identify him?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ve found nothing yet, my Lady.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Was he an Arrakeen native?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.</p>
      
            
<p class="indent"><a id="page82"/>‘He has the native look,’ the man said. ‘Put into that cairn more’n a month ago, by the look, and left there to await our
         coming. Stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place yesterday. I’ll
         stake my reputation on it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No one questions your thoroughness,’ Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I question it, my Lady. We should’ve used sonic probes down there.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I presume that’s what you’re doing now,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, sir.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Send word to my father that we’ll be delayed.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘At once, sir.’ He glanced at Jessica. ‘It’s Hawat’s order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded
         in a safe place.’ Again his eyes swept the room. ‘What of this place?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ve reason to believe it safe,’ she said. ‘Both Hawat and I have inspected it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then I’ll mount guard outside here, m’Lady, until we’ve been over the house once more.’ He bowed, touched his cap to Paul,
         backed out and swung the door closed behind him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul broke the sudden silence, saying: ‘Had we better go over the house later ourselves? Your eyes might see things others
         would miss.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This wing was the only place I hadn’t examined,’ she said. ‘I put it off to last because …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Because Hawat gave it his personal attention,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She darted a quick look at his face, questioning.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you distrust Hawat?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No, but he’s getting old … he’s overworked. We could take some of the load from him.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’d only shame him and impair his efficiency,’ she said. ‘A stray insect won’t be able to wander into this wing after he
         hears about this. He’ll be shamed that…’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We must take our own measures,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor,’ she said. ‘He deserves every respect and trust we can pay him
         … many times over.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page83"/>Paul said: ‘When my father is bothered by something you’ve done he says <em>“Bene Gesserit!”</em> like a swear word.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And what is it about me that bothers your father?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘When you argue with him.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You are not your father, Paul.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Paul thought: <em>It’ll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What’re you holding back?’Jessica asked. ‘This isn’t like you, Paul’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to a sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My father must learn of this at once,’ he said. ‘I’ll radiograph it in code and get it off.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No,’ she said. ‘You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as possible must learn about it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you mean we should trust no one?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s another possibility,’ she said. ‘This message may have been meant to get to us. The people who gave it to us may
         believe it’s true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul’s face remained sturdily somber. ‘To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where the sun of Arrakis was sinking – a yellowed
         ball low above the cliffs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul turned with her, said: ‘I don’t think it’s Hawat, either. Is it possible it’s Yueh?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s not a lieutenant or companion,’ she said. ‘And I can assure you he hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: <em>And it couldn’t be Gurney … or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible. They’re all from families that’ve
            been loyal to us for generations – for good reason.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. <em>So much <a id="page84"/>peril here!</em> She looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal grounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard
         – lines of spice silos in it with stilt-legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders. She could see
         at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall – silos repeated, stuttering across the
         basin.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Slowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon
         that it twinkled with a clear, precise rhythm – a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink-blink-blink …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was <em>too</em> low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Someone signaling!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light
         off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff – very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink!
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And it was gone.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The false star in the cliff winked out immediately.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Signals … and they filled her with premonition.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Why were lights used to signal across the basin?</em> she asked herself. <em>Why couldn’t they use the communications network?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean
         that messages were being sent between his enemies – between Harkonnen agents.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat’s man: ‘All clear, sir … m’Lady. Time to be getting the
         young master to his father.’
      </p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <p class="noindent">It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not
            be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or
            is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find <a id="page85"/>a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.
         </p>
         <p class="right">—from ‘Muad’Dib: Family Commentaries’ by the Princess Irulan</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">The Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower outside Arrakeen. The night’s first moon, an
         oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched
         icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze – yellow … white … blue.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the populous places of the planet: ‘Our Sublime Padishah
         Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness. <em>Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade
            of Arrakis … and were Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They have tried to take the life of my son!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The rage was difficult to suppress.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier
         bringing Paul. The delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of Hawat’s lieutenant.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They have tried to take the life of my son!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around
         the rim like monolithic sentries.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Better a cautious delay than …</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for advancement, completely loyal.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Our Sublime Padishah Emperor</em> …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">If the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor’s private note to his ‘Noble Duke’ – the disdainful
         allusions to veiled men and women: ‘… but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside
         the ordered security of the faufreluches?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page86"/>The Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly
         order. He looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: <em>Around one of those little lights circles Caladan … but I’ll never again see my home.</em> The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but that it reached
         out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this dry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever
         would.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I must mask my feelings,</em> he thought. <em>For the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to have a home, this must be it. I may think of Arrakis as a hell I’ve reached before death,
            but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">A wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling
         two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated—
      </p>
      
      <blockquote class="linegroup">
         <p class="line1">‘My lungs taste the air of Time</p>
         
         <p class="line1">Blown past falling sands …’</p>
         
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="indent">Well, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs
         were desert – barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps
         scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Provided the Harkonnens hadn’t managed to infect even the Fremen with their poisonous schemes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They have tried to take the life of my son!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">A scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet beneath his arms. Blast shutters dropped in front of
         him, blocking the view.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Shuttle’s coming in,</em> he thought. <em>Time to go down and get to work.</em> He turned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to remain calm as he descended, to prepare
         his face for the coming encounter.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They have tried to take the life of my son!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page87"/>The men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow-domed room. They carried their spacebags over their
         shoulders, shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That’s gravity, man!’ ‘How many Gs does this place pull? Feels heavy.’ ‘Nine-tenths of a
         G by the book.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where’s all the loot this place’s supposed to have?’ ‘The Harkonnens
         took it with ’em!’ ‘Me for a hot shower and a soft bed!’ ‘Haven’t you heard, stupid? No showers down here. You scrub your
         ass with sand!’ ‘Hey! Can it! The Duke!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Gurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder, the neck of his nine-string baliset clutched
         in the other hand. They were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from
         the baliset.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding.
         Here was a man who lived outside the faufre-luches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul called him? <em>‘Gurney, the valorous.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck’s wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and
         the scar of the inkvine whip slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air was of casual,
         shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gurney,’ Leto said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord.’ He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. ‘This is the last of them. ‘I’d have preferred coming
         in with the first wave, but…’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There are still some Harkonnens for you,’ the Duke said. ‘Step aside with me, Gurney, where we may talk.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yours to command, my Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They moved into an alcove beside a coin-slot water machine <a id="page88"/>while the men stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘How many men can you let Hawat have?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is Thufir in trouble, Sire?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast
         we may gain a measure of security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare – men who won’t balk
         at a little knife work.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I can let him have three hundred of my best,’ Halleck said. ‘Where shall I send them?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shall I get about it at once, Sire?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild
         Heighliner that brought us is going on about its business, and the shuttle’s supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking
         up a load of spice.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Our spice, m’Lord?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime. They’ve opted to leave with the
         change of fief and the Judge of the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight hundred of them.
         Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘How strong a persuasion, Sire?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and skills we need. The fact that they’re leaving suggests
         they’re not part of the Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group, but he sees assassins
         in every shadow.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And there are some he hasn’t found. But I think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination
         for the Harkonnens.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page89"/>‘Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. I suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn
         on the pressure. You may offer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer twenty per cent higher wages than they received
         under the Harkonnens.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the
         wanderlust on them … well, Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto spoke impatiently: ‘Then use your own discretion in particular cases. Just remember that the treasury isn’t bottomless.
         Hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men – any with open
         sand experience.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand, Sire. “They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the
         captivity of the sand.”’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A very moving quotation,’ the Duke said. ‘Turn your crew over to a lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline,
         then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will direct them. And don’t forget
         the men for Hawat.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Three hundred of the best, Sire.’ He took up his spacebag. ‘Where shall I report to you when I’ve completed my chores?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ve taken over a council room topside here. We’ll hold staff there. I want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with
         armored squads going out first.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto’s eye. ‘Are you anticipating <em>that</em> kind of trouble, Sire? I thought there was a Judge of the Change here.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Both open battle and secret,’ the Duke said. ‘There’ll be blood aplenty spilled here before we’re through.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘“And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land,”’ Halleck quoted.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke sighed. ‘Hurry back, Gurney.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Very good, m’Lord.’ The whipscar rippled to his grin. ‘“Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.”’ He
         <a id="page90"/>turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual amazement – a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery
         phrases … and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift, acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized
         a propaganda corps-man, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels: those who had brought
         their women would want to know the women were safe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that the population
         here appeared to boast more women than men.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately, then
         continued across the room. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Command must always look confident,</em> he thought. <em>All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They have tried to take the life of my son!</em></p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <p class="noindent">Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that
            Muad’Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to
            participate in his father’s first full staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis,
            but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death. They said: ‘O you who know
            what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.’

      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">‘The whole theory of warfare is calculated risk,’ the Duke said, ‘but when it comes to risking your own family, the element
         of <em>calculation</em> gets submerged in … other things.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page91"/>He knew he wasn’t holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field. It was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with
         the long table, old-fashioned three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul sat at the table
         near the map board. He had told his father the experience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened
         him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: ‘Hawat told me that house was secure!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul spoke hesitantly: ‘I was angry, too – at first. And I blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was
         simple, clever, and direct. And it would’ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others – including
         Hawat.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Are you defending him?’ the Duke demanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s wise with much experience,’ Paul said. ‘How many of Hawat’s mistakes can you recall?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I should be the one defending him,’ the Duke said. ‘Not you.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul smiled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son’s. ‘You’ve … matured lately, Son.’ He lifted his hand. ‘It
         gladdens me.’ He matched his son’s smile. ‘Hawat will punish himself. He’ll direct more anger against himself over this than
         both of us together could pour on him.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the night’s blackness. Room lights reflected from
         a balcony railing out there. He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul looked back at
         the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more leathery than ever. He <a id="page92"/>paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord,’ he said, speaking to a point over Leto’s head, ‘I have just learned how I failed you. It becomes necessary that
         I tender my resig—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool,’ the Duke said. He waved to the chair across from Paul. ‘If you made a mistake, it
         was in <em>over</em>estimating the Harkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn’t count on simple tricks. And my son has
         been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training. You didn’t fail there!’
         He tapped the back of the empty chair. ‘Sit down, I say!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat sank into the chair. ‘But—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll hear no more of it,’ the Duke said. ‘The incident is past. We have more pressing business. Where are the others?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I asked them to wait outside while I—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Call them in.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat looked into Leto’s eyes. ‘Sire, I—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I know who my true friends are, Thufir,’ the Duke said. ‘Call in the men.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat swallowed. ‘At once, my Lord.’ He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: ‘Gurney, bring them in.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists,
         an air of eagerness among them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A faint smell of rachag
         stimulant wafted down the table.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s coffee for those who want it,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked over his men, thinking: <em>They’re a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of war.</em> He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Well, gentlemen,’ he said, ‘our civilization appears to’ve fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even
         obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page93"/>Dry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely
         the correct tone to lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I think first we’d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen,’ the Duke said. ‘Thufir?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat glanced up. ‘I’ve some economic matters to go into after my general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen
         appear more and more to be the allies we need. They’re waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing
         openly. They’ve sent us a gift – stillsuits of their own manufacture … maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints
         the Harkonnens left behind …’ He glanced down the table. ‘Their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have
         helped us considerably in our dealings with the Judge of the Change. They’ve also sent some incidental things – jewelry for
         the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You like these people, Thufir?’ asked a man down the table.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat turned to face his questioner. ‘Duncan Idaho says they’re to be admired.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: ‘Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat looked at Paul. ‘From food processing and other evidence, Idaho estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some
         ten thousand people, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We’ve reason to believe there
         are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s something new,’ Leto said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another man down the table cleared his throat, asked: ‘Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated
         they faced an eighteen-day journey.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page94"/>‘It appears,’ the Duke said, ‘that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest. This deserves
         some careful thought. We shouldn’t worry too much about unlicenced frigates working off our planet – it’s always done. But
         to have them completely outside our observation – that’s not good.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You have a plan, Sire?’ Hawat asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke looked at Halleck. ‘Gurney, I want you to head a delegation, an embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen.
         Tell them I’ll ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting
         men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What if the Emperor gets wind of this?’ Halleck asked. ‘He’s very jealous of his CHOAM profits, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto smiled ‘We’ll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs.
         Let the Harkonnens fight that! And we’ll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the Harkonnen system. No more
         graft!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A grin twisted Halleck’s face. ‘Ahh, m’Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would that I could see the Baron’s face when he learns
         of this.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke turned to Hawat. ‘Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, my Lord. They’re being examined in detail even now. I’ve skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Give it, then.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been betraying some boredom, sat up straighter and exchanged
         wide-eyed looks.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck murmured: ‘“For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.”’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You see, gentlemen,’ Leto said. ‘Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked
         away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page95"/>There was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We will have to take it at the point of the sword,’ Leto said. He turned to Hawat. ‘This’d be a good point to report on equipment.
         How many sand-crawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they left us?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the Judge of the Change, my Lord,’ Hawat said. He gestured
         for an aide to pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. ‘They neglect to mention that less than
         half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands – that everything the Harkonnens
         left us is ready to break down and fall apart. We’ll be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if
         a fourth of it’s still working six months from now.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Pretty much as we expected,’ Leto said. ‘What’s the firm estimate on basic equipment?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat glanced at his folder. ‘About nine hundred and thirty harvester factories that can be sent out in a few days. About
         sixty-two hundred and fifty ornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation … carryalls, a little under a thousand.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck said: ‘Wouldn’t it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather
         satellite?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke looked at Hawat. ‘Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We must pursue other avenues for now,’ Hawat said. ‘The Guild agent wasn’t really negotiating with us. He was merely making
         it plain – one Mentat to another – that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop.
         Our task is to find out why before we approach him again.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">One of Halleck’s aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped: ‘There’s no justice in this!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Justice?’ The Duke looked at the man. ‘Who asks for justice? We make our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis – win or
         die. Do you regret casting your lot with us, sir?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man stared at the Duke, then: ‘No, Sire. You couldn’t turn down the richest planetary source of income in our <a id="page96"/>universe … and I could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but …’ He shrugged. ‘…we must all feel bitter at times.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Bitterness I can understand,’ the Duke said. ‘But let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to
         use them. Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may speak
         his mind.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck stirred, said: ‘I think what rankles, Sire, is that we’ve had no volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address
         you as “Leto the Just” and promise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn’t cost them anything.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They don’t know yet who’s going to win this exchange,’ the Duke said. ‘Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks.
         One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.’ He looked at Hawat. ‘We were discussing equipment. Would
         you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with this machinery?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the way down from the Duke. Some of the men farther
         along the table stood up to get a better look at it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about
         forty meters wide. It was basically a long, buglike body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is a harvester factory,’ Hawat said. ‘We chose one in good repair for this projection. There’s one dragline outfit that
         came in with the first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and it’s still running … although I don’t know how … or why.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘If that’s the one they call “Old Maria,” it belongs in a museum,’ an aide said. ‘I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment
         job, a threat hanging over their workers’ heads. Be good or you’ll be assigned to Old Maria.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Chuckles sounded around the table.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind. He
         <a id="page97"/>pointed to the image on the table, said: ‘Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Quick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: <em>No – they have to face the realities here.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp,’ Hawat said. ‘Up here closer to the Shield
         Wall where most of the spicing’s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why don’t we shield them?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘According to Idaho’s report,’ Hawat said, ‘shields are dangerous in the desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for
         hundreds of meters around. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We’ve the Fremen word on this and no reason to
         doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘None at all?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’d be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people,’ Hawat said. ‘Idaho had free access to every
         part of the sietch. He saw no shields or any indication of their use.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s a puzzle,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,’ Hawat said. ‘They had repair depots in every garrison village, and
         their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It doesn’t seem likely,’ Hawat said. ‘It’s theoretically possible, of course – a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed
         to do the trick, but no one’s ever been able to put it to the test.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’d have heard about it before now,’ Halleck said. ‘The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and would’ve acquired
         such a device if it were available. And they’d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I don’t like an unanswered question of this importance,’ Leto said. ‘Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution
         of this problem.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’re already working on it, my Lord.’ He cleared his throat. <a id="page98"/>‘Ah-h, Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn’t mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly
         amused by them.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke frowned, then: ‘The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The solido-image of the harvester factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human
         figures around it. ‘This is a carryall,’ Hawat said. ‘It’s essentially a large ’thopter, whose sole function is to deliver
         a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice
         is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Laughter was abrupt and too loud.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘These ’thopters are fairly conventional,’ Hawat said. ‘Major modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been
         used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded – possibly discarding the shield
         generator’s weight for greater range.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I don’t like this de-emphasis on shields,’ the Duke muttered. And he thought: <em>Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won’t even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us?</em> He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: ‘Let’s get to the working estimate. What’ll our profit figure
         be?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat turned two pages in his notebook. ‘After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, we’ve worked out a first estimate
         on operating costs. It’s based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin.’ He closed his eyes in Mentat
         semitrance, said: ‘Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We’ll be lucky to make it
         at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military
         costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We
         then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent <a id="page99"/>where it belongs.’ He opened his eyes. ‘Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’re working for a solid and permanent planetary base,’ the Duke said. ‘We have to keep a large percentage of the people
         happy – especially the Fremen.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Most especially the Fremen,’ Hawat agreed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Our supremacy on Caladan,’ the Duke said, ‘depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call
         <em>desert</em> power. This may include air power, but it’s possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of ’thopter shields.’
         He shook his head. ‘The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don’t dare. Each
         new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then we’ll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,’ Hawat said. ‘Our output the first two seasons
         should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There it is,’ the Duke said, ‘exactly as we expected. We’ll have to move fast with the Fremen. I’d like five full battalions
         of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s not much time, Sire,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">We don’t have much time, as you well know. They’ll be in here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity.
         How many do you think they’ll ship in, Thufir?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more, Guild troop-transport costs being what they are.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front
         of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different – profits or no profits.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ll do our best, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat’s great age, aware that the old man had served
         three generations of Atreides. <em>Aged.</em> It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve
         of shoulders and the thin set of the lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>So much depends on one aged man,</em> Paul thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page100"/>‘We’re presently in a war of assassins,’ the Duke said, ‘but it has not achieved full scale. Thufir, what’s the condition
         of the Harkonnen machine here?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ve eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain – perhaps
         a hundred people in all.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,’ the Duke said, ‘were they propertied?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Most were well situated, my Lord – in the entrepreneur class.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them,’ the Duke said. ‘File copies with the
         Judge of the Change. We’ll take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their property, take
         everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Thufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. ‘A move worthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames
         me I didn’t think of it first.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul’s face. The others were smiling and nodding.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It’s wrong,</em> Paul thought. <em>This’ll only make the others fight all the harder. They’ve nothing to gain by surrendering.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even
         as it gave them victory.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘“I have been a stranger in a strange land,”’ Halleck quoted.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: <em>Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck. ‘Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade
         to stay with us?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They’re all in useful categories.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No more?’ The Duke pursed his lips, then: ‘Well, pass the word along to—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho <a id="page101"/>came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke’s ear.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto waved him back, said: ‘Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to
         emulate. Idaho’s dark round face turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized
         the mask of serenity over excitement.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Idaho looked down the length of the table, said: ‘We’ve taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen
         themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen
         courier – badly wounded him. We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I’d seen how badly off the
         man was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the attempt to throw something away.’ Idaho glanced down at Leto.
         ‘A knife, m’Lord, a knife the like of which you’ve never seen.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Crysknife?’ someone asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No doubt of it,’ Idaho said. ‘Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like.’ He reached into his tunic, brought out
         a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Keep that blade in its sheath!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the
         man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue – no white in them at all.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Let him enter,’ Idaho whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Pass that man,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band,’ Idaho said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Welcome, sir,’ Leto said. ‘And why shouldn’t we unsheath this blade?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page102"/>Stilgar glanced at Idaho, said: ‘You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us. I would permit you to see the
         blade of the man you befriended.’ His gaze swept the others in the room. ‘But I do not know these others. Would you have them
         defile an honorable weapon?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am the Duke Leto,’ the Duke said. ‘Would you permit me to see this blade?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,’ Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he
         raised a thin, darkly veined hand. ‘I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader – a <em>Fremen</em> leader.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: ‘Who’s he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed,’ the Fremen said. ‘Thus I must tell you the
         way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.’ He passed a dark glance across Idaho.
         ‘They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces. Halleck said: ‘The Duke Leto determines
         whether—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One moment, please,’ Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them. <em>This must not get out of hand,</em> he thought. He addressed himself to the Fremen: ‘Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my
         dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I <em>always</em> pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered – by <em>me.</em> And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening
         blade beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">As the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho’s voice boomed across the room: ‘Hold!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page103"/>Into the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: ‘We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body’s moisture. We accept it
         in the spirit with which it is given.’ And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Aside to the Duke, he said: ‘Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto sank back into his chair, caught Paul’s eye, a rueful grin on his son’s face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around
         the table as understanding came to his men.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen looked at Idaho, said: ‘You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your
         Duke?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s asking me to enlist with him, Sire,’ Idaho said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Would he accept a dual allegiance?’ Leto asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You wish me to go with him, Sire?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I wish you to make your own decision in the matter,’ Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Idaho studied the Fremen. ‘Would you have me under these conditions, Stilgar? There’d be times when I’d have to return to
         serve my Duke.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You fight well and you did your best for our friend,’ Stilgar said. He looked at Leto. ‘Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps
         the crysknife he holds as a mark of allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites observed, but this can
         be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides. There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Duncan?’ Leto asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand, Sire,’ Idaho said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is agreed, then,’ Leto said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho,’ Stilgar said. ‘The body of our friend remains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water.
         It is a bond between us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat’s eye. Hawat nodded, his expression pleased.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I will await below,’ Stilgar said, ‘while Idaho makes farewell with his friends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember
         that when it comes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page104"/>Stilgar started to turn away.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Will you not stay a while?’ Leto asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture, adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed
         what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is there reason to stay?’ the Fremen asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We would honor you,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon,’ the Fremen said. He shot another glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past
         the door guards.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘If the other Fremen match him, we’ll serve each other well,’ Leto said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Idaho spoke in a dry voice: ‘He’s a fair sample, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You understand what you’re to do, Duncan?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Much depends on you, Duncan. We’re going to need at least five battalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on
         us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent bunch.’ Idaho hesitated, then: ‘And, Sire, there’s
         one other thing. One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen friend. The mercenary
         says there’s a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for anyone who’ll bring in a single crysknife.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto’s chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. ‘Why do they want one of those blades so badly?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The knife is ground from a sandworm’s tooth; it’s the mark of the Fremen, Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate
         any sietch in the land. They’d question me unless I were known. I don’t look Fremen. But …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Piter de Vries,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A man of devilish cunning, my Lord,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Guard that knife,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand, m’Lord.’ He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. ‘I’ll report soon as possible. Thufir has my call code.
         Use battle language.’ He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page105"/>They heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat, They smiled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ve much to do, Sire,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And I keep you from your work,’ Leto said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I have the report on the advance bases,’ Hawat said. ‘Shall I give it another time, Sire?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Will it take long?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not for a briefing. It’s said among the Fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on
         Arrakis during the Desert Botanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but there are reports they
         were sealed off before being abandoned.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Equipment in them?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘According to the reports I have from Duncan.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Where are they located?’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The answer to that question,’ Hawat said, ‘is invariably: “Liet knows.” ’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘God knows,’ Leto muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps not, Sire,’ Hawat said. ‘You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could he have been referring to a real person?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Serving two masters,’ Halleck said. ‘It sounds like a religious quotation.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And you should know,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck smiled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This Judge of the Change,’ Leto said, ‘the Imperial ecologist – Kynes … Wouldn’t he know where those bases are?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sire,’ Hawat cautioned, ‘this Kynes is an Imperial servant.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And he’s a long way from the Emperor,’ Leto said. ‘I want those bases. They’d be loaded with materials we could salvage and
         use for repair of our working equipment.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sire!’ Hawat said. ‘Those bases are still legally His Majesty’s fief.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The weather here’s savage enough to destroy anything,’ the Duke said. ‘We can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and
         at least find out if the bases exist.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘ ’Twere dangerous to commandeer them,’ Hawat said. ‘Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of <a id="page106"/>them hold some deep significance for the Fremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word. They appeared deeply
         disturbed by his father’s attitude.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Listen to him, Father,’ Paul said in a low voice. ‘He speaks truth.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sire,’ Hawat said, ‘those bases could give us material to repair every piece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for
         strategic reasons. It’d be rash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority from the Imperium. We
         mustn’t forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do it gently, then,’ the Duke said. ‘I wish to know only if those bases exist.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As you will, Sire.’ Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘All right, then,’ the Duke said. ‘We know what we have ahead of us – work. We’ve been trained for it. We’ve some experience
         in it. We know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your assignments.’ He looked at Halleck.
         ‘Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘ “I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,”’ Halleck intoned.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Someday I’ll catch that man without a quotation and he’ll look undressed,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke turned to Hawat. ‘Set up another command post for intelligence and communications on this floor, Thufir. When you
         have them ready, I’ll want to see you.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support. He turned away, led the procession out of the room. The others
         moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It ended in confusion,</em> Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting
         had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page107"/>For the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeat – not thinking about it out of fear
         or because of warnings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>My father is desperate,</em> he thought. <em>Things aren’t going well for us at all.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Hawat – Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference – subtle hesitations, signs of unrest.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat was deeply troubled by something.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son,’ the Duke said. ‘It’ll be dawn soon, anyway. I’ll inform your mother.’ He
         got to his feet, slowly, stiffly. ‘Why don’t you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m not very tired, sir.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As you will.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Like a caged animal,</em> Paul thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. ‘We’ve discussed the possibility many times.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The old woman seemed so sure of herself,’ Paul said. ‘And the message Mother—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Precautions have been taken,’ the Duke said. He looked around the room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father’s
         eyes. ‘Remain here. There are some things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir.’ He turned, strode out of
         the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been empty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled
         the old woman’s warning: ‘… for the father, nothing.’

         <p class="noindent">On that first day when Muad’Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled
            the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: ‘Mahdi!’ But their shout was more a question than a statement, for
            as yet they could only hope he was the one <a id="page108"/>foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they
            had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.

      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">The Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him. There was the sound of men setting up
         communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced around as Hawat arose from
         a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which
         the Harkonnen <em>‘H’</em> had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The chairs are liberated but quite safe,’ Hawat said. ‘Where is Paul, Sire?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I left him in the conference room. I’m hoping he’ll get some rest without me there to distract him.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Thufir,’ Leto said, ‘the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke pursed his lips. ‘Storehouses are susceptible to destruction.’ He raised a hand as Hawat started to speak. ‘Ignore
         the Emperor’s hoard. He’d secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object if something is destroyed
         which he cannot openly admit that he has?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat shook his head. ‘We’ve few men to spare, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Use some of Idaho’s men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime – there are
         tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As you say, my Lord.’ Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: <em>Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must know I’ve private reports of traitors. Well – best quiet his fears immediately.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Thufir,’ he said, ‘since you’re one of the few I can trust completely, there’s another matter bears discussion. We both <a id="page109"/>know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces … but I have two new reports.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat turned, stared at him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Instead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawat’s agitation.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto studied the old man and, presently, said: ‘You’ve been holding something back, old friend. I should’ve suspected when
         you were so nervous during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat’s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them. They maintained
         their wrinkled stiffness as he said: ‘My Lord, I don’t quite know how to broach this.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,’ the Duke said. ‘You know you can broach <em>any</em> subject with me.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat continued to stare at him, thinking: <em>This is how I like him best. This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I hurt him?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Well?’ Leto demanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat shrugged. ‘It’s a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen courier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee.
         We’ve good reason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note – it’s a thing that could have
         great consequence or no consequence. It’s susceptible to various interpretations.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What’s the delicate content of this note?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the
         acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat rubbed at his lips. ‘It says: “… eto will never suspect, and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source
         alone should be enough to destroy him.” The note was under the Baron’s own seal and I’ve authenticated the seal.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Your suspicion is obvious,’ the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page110"/>‘I’d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,’ Hawat said. ‘My Lord, what if …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Lady Jessica,’ Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. ‘Couldn’t you wring the facts out of this Pardee?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier. The courier, I’m certain, did not know
         what he carried.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I see.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto shook his head, thinking: <em>What a slimy piece of business. There can’t be anything in it. I know my woman.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord, if—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No!’ the Duke barked. ‘There’s a mistake here that—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We cannot ignore it, my Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘She’s been with me for sixteen years! There’ve been countless opportunities for – You yourself investigated the school and
         the woman!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat spoke bitterly: ‘Things have been known to escape me.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides <em>line –</em> meaning Paul, too. They’ve already tried once. Could a woman conspire against her own son?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps she doesn’t conspire against her son. And yesterday’s attempt could’ve been a clever sham.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It couldn’t have been sham.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sire, she isn’t supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know? What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an
         Atreides?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘She’d have moved long before now. Poison in my drink … a stiletto at night. Who has had better opportunity?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Harkonnens mean to <em>destroy</em> you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to kill. There’s a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art
         among vendettas.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke’s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. <em>It cannot be,</em> he thought. <em>The woman has opened her heart to me.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?’ he asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘An interpretation I’ve considered,’ Hawat said. ‘Still …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page111"/>The Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: <em>Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What do you suggest?’ the Duke whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘For now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She should be watched at all times. I will see it’s done unobtrusively. Idaho would
         be the ideal choice for the job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There’s a young man we’ve been training in
         Idaho’s troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as a replacement. He’s gifted in diplomacy.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Don’t jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Of course not, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And what about Paul?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps we could alert Dr Yueh.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto turned his back on Hawat. ‘I leave it in your hands.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I shall use discretion, my Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>At least I can count on that,</em> Leto thought. And he said: ‘I will take a walk. If you need me, I’ll be within the perimeter. The guard can—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord, before you go, I’ve a filmclip you should read. It’s a first-approximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You’ll
         recall you asked me to report on it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke paused, spoke without turning. ‘Will it not wait?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were shouting, though. It was “Mahdi!” They directed the term at the young master.
         When they—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘At Paul?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, my Lord. They’ve a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them
         to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They think Paul is this … this …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They only hope, my Lord.’ Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. ‘I’ll look at it later.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Certainly, my Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Right now, I need time to … think.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page112"/>‘Yes, my Lord.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke took a deep, sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind
         his back, paying little attention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and halls … people who saluted
         and stood aside for him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guard’s robe thrown over him
         and a ditty pack for a pillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing
         field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped
         to attention.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘At ease,’ the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black.
         Low on the southern horizon, the night’s second moon peered through a thin dust haze – an unbelieving moon that looked at
         him with a cynical light.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness,
         he experienced a chill. He shivered.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Anger shot through him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time,</em> he thought. <em>They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And</em> he thought with a touch of sadness: <em>I must rule with eye and claw – as the hawk among lesser birds.</em> Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long,
         bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Some things beggar likeness,</em> he thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond
         the landing field where the night’s faint dew had <a id="page113"/>touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate
         tread of violet … like giant footsteps.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s a beautiful morning, Sire,’ the guard said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, it is.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke nodded, thinking: <em>Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it could become a good home for my son.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe-like devices – dew gatherers.
         Water so precious here that even the dew must be collected.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>And it could be a hideous place,</em> the Duke thought.

      <p class="noindent">The Duke said: ‘Paul, I’m doing a hateful thing, but I must.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast. The thing’s
         sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke’s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by
         one of Hawat’s experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Mahdi!’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Lisan al-Gaib!’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. <em>So that is what they hope,</em> he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings
         of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A hateful thing,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What do you mean, sir?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page114"/>Leto turned, looked down at his son. ‘Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother. They don’t
         know that I’d sooner distrust myself.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I don’t understand, sir.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling
         of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Slowly, speaking in a low voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You might just as well mistrust me,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They have to think they’ve succeeded,’ the Duke said. ‘They must think me this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your
         mother may not know the sham.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But, sir! Why?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your mother’s response must not be an act. Oh, she’s capable of a supreme act … but too much rides on this. I hope to smoke
         out a traitor. It must seem that I’ve been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater
         hurt.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why do you tell me, Father! Maybe I’ll give it away.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’ll not watch you in this thing,’ the Duke said. You’ll keep the secret. You must.’ He walked to the windows, spoke without
         turning. ‘This way, if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the truth – that I never doubted her, not for the smallest
         instant. I should want her to know this.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul recognized the death thoughts in his father’s words, spoke quickly: ‘Nothing’s going to happen to you, sir. The—</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Be silent, Son.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared at his father’s back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">You’re just tired, Father.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I <em>am</em> tired,’ the Duke agreed. ‘I’m morally tired. The melancholy degeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps.
         And we were such strong people once.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul spoke in quick anger: ‘Our House hasn’t degenerated!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hasn’t it?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles <a id="page115"/>beneath hard eyes, a cynical twist of mouth. ‘I should wed your mother, make her my Duchess. Yet … my unwedded state gives
         some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through their marriageable daughters.’ He shrugged. ‘So, I …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mother has explained this to me.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura,’ the Duke said. ‘I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You lead well,’ Paul protested. ‘You govern well. Men follow you willingly and love you.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My propaganda corps is one of the finest,’ the Duke said. Again, he turned to stare out at the basin. ‘There’s greater possibility
         for us here on Arrakis than the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes I think it’d have been better if we’d run for it,
         gone renegade. Sometimes I wish we could sink back into anonymity among the people, become less exposed to …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Father!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Yes, I <em>am</em> tired,’ the Duke said. ‘Did you know we’re using spice residue as raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture
         filmbase?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sir?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We mustn’t run short of filmbase,’ the Duke said. ‘Else, how could we flood village and city with our information? The people
         must learn how well I govern them. How would they know if we didn’t tell them?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">You should get some rest,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, the Duke faced his son. ‘Arrakis has another advantage I almost forgot to mention. Spice is in everything here. You
         breathe it and eat it in almost everything. And I find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to some of the most common
         poisons of the Assassins’ Handbook. And the need to watch every drop of water puts all food production – yeast culture, hydroponics,
         chemavit, everything – under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off large segments of our population with poison –
         and we cannot be attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: ‘I have to have someone I can say these things to, Son.’ He sighed,
         glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were <a id="page116"/>gone now – trampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,’ the Duke said. ‘Here, we must scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance,
         Paul. What is to become of you if anything happens to me? You’ll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House – running,
         hunted.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his father this despondent.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘To hold Arrakis,’ the Duke said, ‘one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self-respect.’ He pointed out the window
         to the Atreides green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field. ‘That honorable banner
         could come to mean many evil things.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul swallowed in a dry throat. His father’s words carried futility, a sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling
         in his chest.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. ‘Power and fear,’ he said. ‘The tools of statecraft. I must
         order new emphasis on guerrilla training for you. That filmclip there – they call you “Mahdi” – “Lisan al-Gaib” – as a last
         resort, you might capitalize on that.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did its work, but remembering the words of fear
         and doubt.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What’s keeping that ecologist?’ the Duke muttered. ‘I told Thufir to have him here early.’</p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <p class="noindent">My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was
            disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong resemblance
            between them – my father and this man in the portrait – both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold
            eyes. ‘Princess-daughter,’ my father said, ‘I would that you’d been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman.’
            My father was 71 at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember <a id="page117"/>deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities
            that made them enemies.

      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="noindent">His first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr Kynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist
         to whom legends were merely interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy fitted the ancient prophecy so
         precisely. He had ‘the questing eyes,’ and the air of ‘reserved candor.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Of course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother Goddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce
         Him on the scene. Still, there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field’s administration building. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby,
         humming softly on standby like a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and the faint air-distortion
         of a shield around him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: <em>Arrakis has a surprise for them there!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back. He strode on ahead toward the building’s entrance
         – the dark hole in plastic-coated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less suitable than a cave.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Movement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit
         at the left shoulder.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them heavily armed – slow pellet stunners, swords and
         shields. Behind them came a tall man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore a jubba cloak with Atreides crest at the
         breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with the garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one
         side. It lacked a free-swinging, striding rhythm.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Beside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but <a id="page118"/>rounder in the face. The youth seemed small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have. But the young body carried a sense
         of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to others. And he wore
         the same style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made one think the boy had always worn such clothing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see,’</em> went the prophecy.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes shook his head, telling himself: <em>They’re just people.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">With the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized – Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still
         his resentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to <em>behave</em> with the Duke and ducal heir.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘You may call the Duke “my Lord” or “Sire.” “Noble Born” also is correct, but usually reserved for more formal occasions.
            The son may be addressed as “young Master” or “my Lord.” The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks little familiarity</em>’.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: <em>They’ll learn soon enough who’s master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that Mentat, will they? Expect me
            to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do they?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The import of Hawat’s questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the Imperial bases. And it was obvious they’d learned of
         the bases from Idaho.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I will have Stilgar send Idaho’s head to this Duke,</em> Kynes told himself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots crunching the sand.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes bowed. ‘My Lord, Duke.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">As he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the
         desert in loose robe, stillsuit, and low boots. The man’s hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side, revealing long
         sandy hair, a sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless blue-within-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged
         his eye sockets.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’re the ecologist,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page119"/>‘We prefer the old title here, my Lord,’ Kynes said. Planetologist.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As you wish,’ the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. ‘Son, this is the Judge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the
         man set here to see that the forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief.’ He glanced at Kynes. ‘And this is
         my son.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Are you a Fremen?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes smiled. ‘I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master. But I am in His Majesty’s service, the Imperial Planetologist.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul nodded, impressed by the man’s air of strength. Halleck had pointed Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration
         building: ‘The man standing there with the Fremen escort – the one moving now toward the ornithopter.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight mouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in
         Paul’s ear: ‘Odd sort of fellow. Has a precise way of speaking – clipped off, no fuzzy edges – razor-apt.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And the Duke, behind them, had said: ‘Scientist type.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Now, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the impact of personality, as though he were blood royal,
         born to command.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I hope they fit well, my Lord,’ Kynes said. ‘They’re of Fremen make and as near as possible the dimensions given me by your
         man Halleck here.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I was concerned that you said you couldn’t take us into the desert unless we wore these garments,’ the Duke said. ‘We can
         carry plenty of water. We don’t intend to be out long and we’ll have air cover – the escort you see overhead right now. It
         isn’t likely we’d be forced down.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: ‘You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only
         of possibilities.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck stiffened. ‘The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page120"/>Leto gave Halleck their private handsignal to desist, said: ‘Our ways are new here, Gurney. We must make allowances.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As you wish, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We are indebted to you, Dr Kynes,’ Leto said. ‘These suits and the consideration for our welfare will be remembered.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">On impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said ‘ “The gift is the blessing of the giver.”’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had left in the shade of the administration building
         leaped up from their squatting repose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: ‘Lisan al-Gaib!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard away. They fell back, grumbling among themselves,
         trailed away around the building.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Most interesting,’ Leto said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: ‘Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention
         to them. They mean no harm.’ But he thought of the words of the legend: ‘<em>They will greet you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto’s assessment of Kynes – based partly on Hawat’s brief verbal report (guarded and full of suspicions) – suddenly crystallized:
         the man <em>was</em> Fremen. Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter
         urban areas – but it had seemed an honor guard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his tongue
         and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul’s first question had been direct and pertinent.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes had gone native.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shouldn’t we be going, Sire?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke nodded. ‘I’ll fly my own ’thopter. Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One moment, please,’ Kynes said. ‘With your permission, Sire, I must check the security of your suits.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: ‘I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours … my Lord. I’m well <a id="page121"/>aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while you’re in my care.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke frowned, thinking: <em>How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet…
            to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. ‘We’re in your hands,’ the Duke said. He stepped
         forward, opening his robe, saw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where he was. ‘And,
         if you’d be so kind,’ the Duke said, ‘I’d appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Certainly,’ Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals, speaking as he examined the suit. ‘It’s basically
         a micro-sandwich – a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system.’ He adjusted the shoulder seals. ‘The skin-contact layer’s
         porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body … near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers …’ Kynes
         tightened the chest fit. ‘… include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt’s reclaimed.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: ‘Most interesting.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Breathe deeply,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke obeyed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Keynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. ‘Motions of the body, especially breathing,’ he said, ‘and some osmotic action
         provide the pumping force.’ He loosened the chest fit slightly. ‘Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you
         draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube. ‘Efficient and convenient,’ he said. ‘Good engineering.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes knelt, examined the leg seals. ‘Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads,’ he said, and stood up, felt the neck
         fitting, lifted a sectioned flap there. ‘In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils
         with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit
         in good working order, you won’t lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day – even if you’re caught in the Great Erg.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page122"/>‘A thimbleful a day,’ the Duke said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes pressed a finger against the suit’s forehead pad, said: ‘This may rub a little. If it irritates you, please tell me.
         I could slip-patch it a bit tighter.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My thanks,’ the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now
         – tighter and less irritating.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned to Paul. ‘Now, let’s have a look at you, lad.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A good man but he’ll have to learn to address us properly,</em> the Duke thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment.
         In his force-consciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of
         adjusting the adhesion tabs under Gurney’s inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the chest
         to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck
         and forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. ‘You’ve worn a stillsuit before?’ he asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is the first time.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then someone adjusted it for you?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do that?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It … seemed the right way.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That it most certainly is.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: <em>‘He shall know your ways as though born to them.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We waste time,’ the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting ’thopter, led the way, accepting the guard’s salute with a nod.
         He climbed in, fastened his safety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others clambered aboard.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft – soft luxury of gray-green upholstery, gleaming
         <a id="page123"/>instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>So soft!</em> he thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘All secure, Sire,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip – once, twice. They were airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly
         and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Southeast over the Shield Wall,’ Kynes said. ‘That’s where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Right.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Someday I may show you a sietch factory,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I would find that interesting,’ the Duke said. ‘I note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Inferior copies,’ Kynes said. ‘Any Dune man who values his skin wears a Fremen suit.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And it’ll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major water loss is through the palms of your hands,’
         Kynes said. ‘You can wear suit gloves if you’re not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the open desert
         rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush. It inhibits perspiration.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield Wall – chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow-brown
         crossed by black lines of fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground from space and left it where
         it smashed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south. The
         sand fingers ran out into the basin – a dry delta outlined against darker rock.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes,
         slow pellet stunners at the waist, coin-sized emergency <a id="page124"/>transmitters on cords around their necks. Both the Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheaths and the sheaths appeared
         well worn. These people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed strength. There was a poise to them totally
         unlike the Harkonnens.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you say we observed the rules?’ Leto asked. He glanced
         at Kynes, back to their course.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Harkonnens left; you came,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And is everything as it should be?’ Leto asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Momentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes’ jaw. ‘As Planetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a
         direct subject of the Imperium … my Lord.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke smiled grimly. ‘But we both know the realities.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Indeed? And what is your work?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the brief silence, Paul thought: <em>He’s pushing this Kynes too hard.</em> Paul glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren landscape.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes spoke stiffly: ‘You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Of course.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is mostly dry land biology and botany … some geological work – core drilling and testing. You never really exhaust the
         possibilities of an entire planet.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you also investigate the spice?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man’s cheek. ‘A curious question, my Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from those of the Harkonnens. I don’t care if you study
         the spice as long as I share what you discover.’ He glanced at the planetologist. ‘The Harkonnens discouraged investigation
         of the spice, didn’t they?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes stared back without answering.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You may speak plainly,’ the Duke said, ‘without fear for your skin.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,’ Kynes <a id="page125"/>muttered. And he thought: <em>What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough to enlist with him?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. ‘I detect a sour note in your voice, sir. We’ve waded in here with
         our mob of tame killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we’re different from the Harkonnens?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ve read the propaganda you’ve flooded into sietch and village,’ Kynes said. ‘ “Love the good Duke!” Your corps of—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Here now!’ Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window, leaned forward.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul put a hand on Halleck’s arm.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gurney!’ the Duke said. He glanced back. ‘This man’s been long under the Harkonnens.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck sat back. ‘Ayah.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your man Hawat’s subtle,’ Kynes said, ‘but his object’s plain enough.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Will you open those bases to us, then?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes spoke curtly: ‘They’re His Majesty’s property.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’re not being used.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They could be used.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Does His Majesty concur?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. ‘Arrakis could be an Eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He didn’t answer my question,</em> the Duke thought. And he said: ‘How is a planet to become an Eden without money?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What is money,’ Kynes asked, ‘if it won’t buy the services you need?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Ah now!</em> the Duke thought. And he said: ‘We’ll discuss this another time. Right now, I believe we’re coming to the edge of the Shield
         Wall. Do I hold the same course?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The same course,’ Kynes muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain
         and a knife-edged shelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in
         the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled
         air, Paul couldn’t be sure.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page126"/>‘Are there any plants down there?’ Paul asked.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Some,’ Kynes said. ‘This latitude’s life-zone has mostly what we call minor water stealers – adapted to raiding each other
         for moisture, gobbling up the trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has learned how to survive
         under these rigors. If <em>you</em> get caught down there, you imitate that life or you die.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You mean steal water from each other?’ Paul asked. The idea outraged him, and his voice betrayed his emotion.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s done,’ Kynes said, ‘but that wasn’t precisely my meaning. You see, my climate demands a special attitude toward water.
         You are aware of water at all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And the Duke thought: ‘… <em>my climate!’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord,’ Kynes said. ‘There’s a blow coming up from the west.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked the ’thopter around, noting the way the escort’s wings
         reflected milky orange from the dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This should clear the storm’s edge,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it,’ Paul said. ‘Will it really cut the strongest metals?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘At this altitude, it’s not sand but dust,’ Kynes said. ‘The danger is lack of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ll see actual spice mining today?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Very likely,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his mother called ‘registering’ the person. He had
         Kynes now – tune of voice, each detail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the man’s robe told
         of a knife in an arm sheath. The waist bulged strangely. It was said that desert men wore a belted sash into which they tucked
         small necessities. Perhaps the bulges came from such a sash – certainly not from a concealed shield belt. A copper pin engraved
         with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of Kynes’ robe. Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner
         of the hood which was thrown back over his shoulders.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page127"/>Halleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear compartment and brought out his baliset. Kynes looked
         around as Halleck tuned the instrument then returned his attention to their course.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What would you like to hear, young Master?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You choose, Gurney,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang softly:</p>
      
      <blockquote class="linegroup">
         <p class="line">‘Our fathers ate manna in the desert,</p>
         
         <p class="line">In the burning places where whirlwinds came.</p>
         
         <p class="line">Lord, save us from that horrible land!</p>
         
         <p class="line">Save us … oh-h-h-h, save us</p>
         
         <p class="line">From the dry and thirsty land.’</p>
         
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes glanced at the Duke, said: ‘You <em>do</em> travel with a light complement of guards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gurney?’ The Duke chuckled. ‘Gurney’s one of a kind. I like him with me for his eyes. His eyes miss very little.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The planetologist frowned.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Without missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:</p>
      
      <blockquote class="linegroup">
         <p class="line">‘For I am like an owl of the desert, o!</p>
         
         <p class="line">Aiyah! am like an owl of tme des-ert!’</p>
         
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument panel, thumbed it to life, said: ‘Leader to Escort Gemma.
         Flying object at nine o’clock, Sector B. Do you identify it?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s merely a bird,’ Kynes said, and added: You have sharp eyes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The panel speaker crackled, then: ‘Escort Gemma. Object examined under full amplification. It’s a large bird.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of intermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his
         father must be. Every sense was at full alert.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page128"/>‘I’d not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert,’ the Duke said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s likely an eagle,’ Kynes said. ‘Many creatures have adapted to this place.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain. Paul looked down from their two thousand meters’ altitude, saw the wrinkled
         shadow of their craft and escort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck’s music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not from the deep desert,’ Kynes said. ‘Men have walked out of the second zone several times. They’ve survived by crossing
         the rock areas where worms seldom go.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The timbre of Kynes’ voice held Paul’s attention. He felt his senses come alert the way they were trained to do.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h, the worms,’ the Duke said. ‘I must see one sometime.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You may see one today,’ Kynes said. ‘Wherever there is spice, there are worms.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Always?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Always.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is there relationship between worm and spice?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. ‘They defend spice <em>sands.</em> Each worm has a – territory. As to the spice … who knows? Worm specimens we’ve examined lead us to suspect complicated chemical
         interchanges within them. We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated acid forms elsewhere. I’ll give
         you my monograph on the subject.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And a shield’s no defense?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shields!’ Kynes sneered. ‘Activate a shield within the worm zone and you seal your fate. Worms ignore territory lines, come
         from far around to attack a shield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘How are worms taken, then?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is the only known way of killing and preserving an
         <a id="page129"/>entire worm,’ Kynes said. ‘They can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of its own. Barring
         atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely. They’re incredibly tough.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why hasn’t an effort been made to wipe them out?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Too expensive,’ Kynes said. ‘Too much area to cover.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings, told him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths.
         And he thought: <em>If there’s a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy the spice.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No one will have to walk out of the desert soon,’ the Duke said. ‘Trip these little transmitters at our necks and rescue
         is on its way. All our workers will be wearing them before long. We’re setting up a special rescue service.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Very commendable,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your tone says you don’t agree,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Agree? Of course I agree, but it won’t be much use. Static electricity from sandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters
         short out. They’ve been tried here before, you know. Arrakis is tough on equipment. And if a worm’s hunting you there’s not
         much time. Frequently, you have no more than fifteen or twenty minutes.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What would you advise?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You ask my advice?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As planetologist, yes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’d follow my advice?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘If I found it sensible.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke turned his attention from the controls. ‘That’s all?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s all. Never travel alone.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What if you’re separated by a storm and forced down?’ Halleck asked. ‘Isn’t there anything you could do?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Anything</em> covers much territory,’ Kynes said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What would <em>you</em> do?’ Paul asked.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the Duke. ‘I’d remember to protect the integrity of my
         <a id="page130"/>stillsuit. If I were outside the worm zone or in rock, I’d stay with the ship. If I were down in open sand, I’d get away from
         the ship as fast as I could. About a thousand meters would be far enough. Then I’d hide beneath my robe. A worm would get
         the ship, but it might miss me.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then what?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes shrugged. ‘Wait for the worm to leave.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s all?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out,’ Kynes said. ‘You must walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins
         – head for the nearest rock zone. There are many such zones. You might make it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Drum sand?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A condition of sand compaction,’ Kynes said. ‘The slightest step sets it drumming. Worms always come to that.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And a tidal dust basin?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries. Some are so vast they have currents and tides.
         All will swallow the unwary who step into them.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:</p>
      
      <blockquote class="linegroup">
         <p class="line">‘Wild beasts of the desert do hunt there,</p>
         
         <p class="line">Waiting for the innocents to pass.</p>
         
         <p class="line">Oh-h-h, tempt not the gods of the desert,</p>
         
         <p class="line">Lest you seek a lonely epitaph.</p>
         
         <p class="line">The perils of the—’</p>
         
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="indent">He broke off, leaned forward. ‘Dust cloud ahead, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I see it, Gurney.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s what we seek.’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One of your factory crawlers,’ Kynes said. ‘It’s on the surface and that means it’s on spice. The cloud is vented sand being
         expelled after the spice has been centrifugally removed. There’s no other cloud quite like it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page131"/>‘Aircraft over it,’ the Duke said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I see two … three … four spotters,’ Kynes said. ‘They’re watching for wormsign.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Wormsign?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A sandwave moving toward the crawler. They’ll have seismic probes on the surface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for
         the wave to show.’ Kynes swung his gaze around the sky. ‘Should be a carryall wing around, but I don’t see it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The worm always comes, eh?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Always.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul leaned forward, touched Kynes’ shoulder. ‘How big an area does each worm stake out?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That depends on the size of the worm.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What’s the variation?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small ones—’ He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes.
         The ship bucked as its tail pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The craft became a full ’thopter
         as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle beat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory
         crawler.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is that wormsign?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction, and Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden
         maneuver, had surged ahead, but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some three kilometers away.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Where the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward the horizon and, running through them as a level
         line stretching into the distance, came an elongated mount-in-motion – a cresting of sand. It reminded Paul of the way a big
         fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the surface.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Worm,’ Kynes said. ‘Big one.’ He leaned back, grabbed the microphone from the panel, punched out a new frequency selection.
         Glancing at the grid chart on rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: ‘Calling crawler at Delta Ajaxniner.
         <a id="page132"/>Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge, please.’ He waited.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: ‘Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They seem pretty calm about it,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes spoke into the microphone: ‘Unlisted flight – north and east of you about three kilometers. Wormsign is on intercept
         course, your position, estimated contact twenty-five minutes.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another voice rumbled from the speaker: ‘This is Spotter Control. Sighting confirmed. Stand by for contact fix.’ There was
         a pause, then: ‘Contact in twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who’s on that unlisted flight? Over.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke. ‘Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes. Why?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who’d be listening?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, the speaker crackled, then: ‘This is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets bonus credit for that spot? Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck glanced at the Duke.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes said: ‘There’s a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first worm warning. They want to know—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Tell them who had first sight of that worm,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke nodded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone: ‘Spotter credit to the Duke Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of static: ‘We read and thank you.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves,’ Halleck ordered. ‘Tell them it’s the Duke’s wish.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes took a deep breath, then: ‘It’s the Duke’s wish that you divide the bonus among your crew. Do you read? Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Acknowledged and thank you,’ the speaker said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke said: ‘I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in public relations.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their <a id="page133"/>safety,’ Halleck said. ‘Word will get around. It was on an area working frequency – not likely Harkonnen agents heard.’ He
         glanced out at their air cover. ‘And we’re a pretty strong force. It was a good risk.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory crawler. ‘What happens now?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s a carryall wing somewhere close,’ Kynes said. ‘It’ll come in and lift off the crawler.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What if the carryall’s wrecked?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Some equipment <em>is</em> lost,’ Kynes said. ‘Get in close over the crawler, my Lord; you’ll find this interesting.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into turbulent air over the crawler.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic monster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and
         blue beetle with many wide tracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked into dark sand in
         front of it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Rich spice bed by the color,’ Kynes said. ‘They’ll continue working until the last minute.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper descent as he settled lower in a circling glide above the
         crawler. A glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler’s pipe vents, looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shouldn’t we be hearing them call in the carryall?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They usually have the wing on a different frequency,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shouldn’t they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?’ the Duke asked. ‘There should be twenty-six men on that
         machine down there, not to mention cost of equipment.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes said: ‘You don’t have enough ex—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: ‘Any of you see the wing? He isn’t answering.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an <a id="page134"/>abrupt override signal, then silence and the first voice: ‘Report by the numbers! Over.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is Spotter Control. Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling off northwest. I don’t see him now. Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Spotter one: negative. Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Spotter two: negative. Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Spotter three: negative. Over.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Silence.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke looked down. His own craft’s shadow was just passing over the crawler. ‘Only four spotters, is that right?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Correct,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There are five in our party,’ the Duke said. ‘Our ships are larger. We can crowd in three extra each. Their spotters ought
         to be able to lift off two each.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul did the mental arithmetic, said: ‘That’s three short.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why don’t they have two carryalls to each crawler?’ barked the Duke.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You don’t have enough extra equipment,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘All the more reason we should protect what we have!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Where could that carryall go?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Could’ve been forced down somewhere out of sight,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its switch. ‘How could they lose sight of a carryall?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. ‘This is your Duke. We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner’s
         crew. All spotters are ordered to comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We will take the west. Over.’ He reached down,
         punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his own air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the speaker: ‘… almost a full load of spice! We have almost
         a full load! We can’t leave that for a damned worm! Over.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Damn the spice!’ the Duke barked. He grabbed back the <a id="page135"/>microphone, said: ‘We can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but three of you. Draw straws or decide
         any way you like who’s to go. But you’re going, and that’s an order!’ He slammed the microphone back into Kynes’ hands, muttered:
         ‘Sorry,’ as Kynes shook an injured finger.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘How much time?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Nine minutes,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke said: ‘The ship has more power than the others. If we took off under jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd
         in an additional man.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That sand’s soft,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings, Sire,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not on this ship,’ the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the ’thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings
         tipped up, braked the ’thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint mechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more
         audible as the Duke opened his door.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Immediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon – heavy and pungent.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">With a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the other side of the crawler. The Duke’s own escort
         swooped in to land in line with him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the ’thopters were dwarfed by it – gnats beside a warrior beetle.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat,’ the Duke said. He manually cranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their
         angle, checked the jet pod controls. ‘Why the devil aren’t they coming out of that machine?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’re hoping the carryall will show up,’ Kynes said. ‘They still have a few minutes.’ He glanced off to the east.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">All turned to look in the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in
         the air.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: ‘Two of you toss out your shield generators. By <a id="page136"/>the numbers. You can carry one more man that way. We’re not leaving any men for that monster.’ He keyed back to the working
         frequency, barked: ‘All right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This is a command from your Duke! On the double or I’ll
         cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear, another at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding
         and scrambling down to the sand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped down to a track and
         then to the sand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step, shouted: ‘Two men each into your spotters.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man in the patched robe began tolling off pairs of his crew, pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Four over here!’ the Duke shouted. ‘Four into that ship back there!’ He jabbed a finger at an escort ’thopter directly behind
         him. The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. And four into that ship over there!’ He pointed to the
         other escort that had shed its shield generator. ‘Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I hear the worm, but I can’t see it,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The others heard it then – an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Damn sloppy way to operate,’ the Duke muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Aircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a time in his home planet’s jungles, a sudden emergence
         into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The spice workers slogged up to the side of the ’thopter, started climbing in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them
         into the rear.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘In you go, boys!’ he snapped. ‘On the double!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments
         on their stillsuits. He filed the information in his memory for future action. His father would have to order tighter
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page137"/>stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn’t watch such things.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The last man came gasping into the rear, said: ‘The worm! It’s almost on us! Blast off!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: ‘We still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate. Is that
         right, Kynes?’ He shut his door, checked it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Almost exactly, my Lord,’ Kynes said, and he thought: <em>A cool one, this duke.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘All secure here, Sire,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments,
         punched the jet sequence.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The take-off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the
         Duke handled the controls – gently, surely. The ’thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his instruments, glanced
         left and right at his wings.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘She’s very heavy, Sire,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Well within the tolerances of this ship,’ the Duke said. ‘You didn’t really think I’d risk this cargo, did you Gurney?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck grinned, said: ‘Not a bit of it, Sire.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve – climbing over the crawler.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about
         four hundred meters from the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The worm is now beneath the crawler,’ Kynes said. ‘You are about to witness a thing few have seen.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool
         began forming there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds
         of meters around.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then they saw it!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening white spokes within it. The hole’s diameter was at least
         <a id="page138"/>twice the length of the crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid into that opening in a billow of dust and
         sand. The hole pulled back.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gods, what a monster!’ muttered a man beside Paul.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Got all our floggin’ spice!’ growled another.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Someone is going to pay for this,’ the Duke said. ‘I promise you that.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">By the very flatness of his father’s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Bless the Maker and His water,’ Kynes murmured. ‘Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May
         He keep the world for His people.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What’s that you’re saying?’ the Duke asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Kynes remained silent.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at the back of Kynes’ head. One of them whispered:
         ‘Liet.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another of the rescued men began coughing – dry and rasping. Presently, he gasped: ‘Curse this hell hole!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said: ‘Be you still, Coss. You but worsen your cough.’ He stirred among
         the men until he could look through them at the back of the Duke’s head. ‘You be the Duke Leto, I warrant,’ he said. ‘It’s
         to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,’ Halleck muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his father’s jaw. One walked softly when
         the Duke was in a rage.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto began easing his ’thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had
         withdrawn into the depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand
         depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who’s that down there?’ the Duke barked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page139"/>‘Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,’ said the tall Dune man.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why wasn’t something said about them?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It was the chance they took, Soor,’ the Dune man said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord,’ said Kynes, ‘these men know it’s of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ll send a ship from base for them!’ the Duke snapped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As you wish, my Lord,’ Kynes said. ‘But likely when the ship gets here there’ll be no one to rescue.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ll send a ship anyway,’ the Duke said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They were right beside where the worm came up,’ Paul said. ‘How’d they escape?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You waste fuel here, Sire,’ Halleck ventured.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Aye, Gurney.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke brought his craft toward the Shield Wall. His escort came down from circling stations, took up positions above and
         on both sides.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided
         across the surface so surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Fremen!</em> Paul thought. <em>Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course – because</em> they <em>are in no danger?</em> They <em>know how to live here!</em> They <em>know how to outwit the worm!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">What were Fremen doing on that crawler?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes whirled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul – blue within blue within blue. ‘Who be this lad?’ he asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: ‘This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?’ the man asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They fit the description,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes snorted. ‘You can’t tell Fremen just by looking at them!’ He looked at the Dune man. ‘You. Who were those men?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page140"/>‘Friends of one of the others,’ the Dune man said. ‘Just friends from a village who wanted to see the spice sands.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned away. Fremen!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But he was remembering the words of the legend: ‘<em>The Lisan al-Gaib shall see through all subterfuge.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They be dead now, most likely, young Soor,’ the Dune man said. ‘We should not speak unkindly on them.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul spoke dryly: ‘A terrible place for them to die.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Without turning, Kynes said: ‘When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature’s wants
         to direct him to that place.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: <em>This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over the spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the
            men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men’s lives had him in a rage. A leader such
            as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Against his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: <em>I like this duke.</em></p>

      <p class="noindent">In the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow
         glows upward onto the black bull’s head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the Old Duke.
         Beneath these talismans, white linen shone around the <a id="page141"/>burnished reflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great table – little
         archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic
         central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison snooper
         had been concealed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Pausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about the poison snooper and what it signified in his
         society.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>All of a pattern,</em> he thought. <em>You can plumb us by our language – the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone
            try chaumurky tonight – poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas – poison in the food?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He shook his head.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Beside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to
         keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Flanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of
         towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into
         a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle
         at the door. After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>How typical of a Harkonnen fief</em> the Duke thought. <em>Every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived.</em> He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his stomach.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The custom stops here!’ he muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He saw a serving woman – one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommended – hovering at the doorway from the
         kitchen across from him. The Duke signaled with upraised hand. She moved out of the shadows, scurried around the table toward
         him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue-within-blue eyes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord wishes?’ She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He gestured. ‘Have these basins and towels removed.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But … Noble Born …’ She looked up, mouth gaping.</p>
            <p class="indent"><a id="page142"/>‘I know the custom!’ he barked. ‘Take these basins to the front door. While we’re eating and until we’ve finished, each beggar
         who calls may have a full cup of water. Understood?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Her leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger …</p>
      
      <p class="indent">With sudden insight, Leto realized she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing
         a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">His face clouded, and he growled: ‘I’m posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old
         women. He remembered open water and waves – days of grass instead of sand – dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm
         leaves.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">All gone.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I’m getting old,</em> he thought. <em>I’ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in what? An old woman’s greed.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled
         there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer
         down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory,
         a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment,
         a thin and hard-faced woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various smuggling,
         spying, and blackmail operations.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Most of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type – decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable
         sensousness.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Even without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen
         warm colors – a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed hair.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof <a id="page143"/>against his recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these shades – that he saw her as a rustling
         of warm colors.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Nearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable,
         the curling black hair neatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat – <em>‘Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant surveillance.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke glanced around the room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers
         of the House Troop. The Duke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treating
         all equally with an air of reserved nobility.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He’ll wear the title well,</em> the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching
         drinks (and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the chattering faces, Paul was suddenly
         repelled by them. They were cheap masks locked on festering thoughts – voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every
         breast.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I’m in a sour mood,</em> he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that. He knew his mood’s source. He hadn’t wanted to attend this function,
         but his father had been firm. ‘You have a place – a position to uphold. You’re old enough to do this. You’re almost a man.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">As Leto approached Jessica’s group, the water-shipper was asking: ‘Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">From behind the man, the Duke said: ‘We haven’t gone that far in our thinking, sir.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. ‘Ah-h, the Duke,’ he said. ‘We missed you.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto glanced at Jessica. ‘A thing needed doing.’ He returned <a id="page144"/>his attention to the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins, adding: ‘As far as I’m concerned,
         the old custom ends now.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is this a ducal order, m’Lord?’ the man asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I leave that to your own … ah … conscience,’ the Duke said. He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">One of the women said: ‘I think it’s a very generous gesture – giving water to the—’ Someone shushed her.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial
         Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The water-shipper asked in an angry voice: ‘Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This custom has been changed,’ Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessica’s face, thought: <em>A frown does not become her, but it’ll increase rumors of friction between us.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘With the Duke’s permission,’ the water-shipper said, ‘I’d like to inquire further about customs.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto heard the sudden oily tone in the man’s voice, noted the watchful silence in this group, the way heads were beginning
         to turn toward them around the room.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Isn’t it almost time for dinner?’Jessica asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But our guest has some questions,’ Leto said. And he looked at the water-shipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes
         and thick lips, recalling Hawat’s memorandum: ‘… <em>and this water-shipper is a man to watch – Lingar Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled
            him.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Water customs are so interesting,’ Bewt said, and there was a smile on his face. ‘I’m curious what you intend about the conservatory
         attached to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people’s faces … m’Lord?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his
         own ducal castle, especially since they now had Bewt’s signature over a contract of allegiance. The action had taken, also,
         a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed
         at a signal … The man looked capable of such a thing. <a id="page145"/>Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory,’ Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. ‘We intend to keep it,
         certainly, but only to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of Arrakis may
         be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Bless her!</em> Leto thought. <em>Let our water-shipper chew on that.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your interest in water and weather control is obvious,’ the Duke said. ‘I’d advise you to diversify your holdings. One day,
         water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And he thought: <em>Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt’s organization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at
            once. No man is going to hold a club over my head!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Bewt nodded, the smile still on his face. A commendable dream, my Lord.’ He withdrew a pace.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto’s attention was caught by the expression on Kynes’ face. The man was staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured – like
         a man in love … or caught in a religious trance.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes’ thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: <em>‘And they shall share your most precious dream.’</em> He spoke directly to Jessica: ‘Do you bring the shortening of the way?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah, Dr Kynes,’ the water-shipper said. ‘You’ve come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: ‘It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can
         inflict a man with fatal carelessness.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They have many strange sayings in the desert,’ Bewt said, but his voice betrayed uneasiness.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself. Kynes had said: ‘… the
         shortening of the way.’ In the old tongue, the phrase translated as ‘Kwisatz Haderach.’ The planetologist’s odd question seemed
         to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.
      </p>
      
            <p class="indent"><a id="page146"/><em>Kwisatz Haderach,</em> Jessica thought. <em>Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too?</em> The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. <em>He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt’s voice lifted above the renewed
         hum of conversations: ‘Many people have sought to change Arrakis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Into the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: ‘Dinner is served,
         my Lord.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,’ she said, and smiled: ‘Shall we change that one,
         too, my Lord?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He spoke coldly: ‘That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for now.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained,</em> he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. <em>Who among you believes this lie?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week. <em>He acts like a man struggling with himself,</em> she thought. <em>Is it because I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our
            officers and men with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses that
            fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: <em>‘Sire! I forbid it!’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">A grim smile touched the Duke’s mouth. What a scene that had been. And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending
         the dinner, Hawat had shaken his head. ‘I have bad feelings about this, my Lord,’ he’d said. ‘Things move too swiftly on Arrakis.
         That’s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded
         at something the young woman said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page147"/>‘Her father manufactures stillsuits,’Jessica said. ‘I’m told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one
         of the man’s suits.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who’s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?’ the Duke asked. ‘I don’t place him.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A late addition to the list,’ she whispered. ‘Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gurney arranged?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it. The smuggler’s called Tuek,
         Esmar Tuek. He’s a power among his kind. They all know him here. He’s dined at many of the houses.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why is he here?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Everyone here will ask that question,’ she said. ‘Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence. He’ll also serve
         notice that you’re prepared to back up your orders against graft – by enforcement from the smugglers’ end as well. This was
         the point Hawat appeared to like.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m not sure I like it.’ He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. Why didn’t
         you invite some Fremen?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s Kynes,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, there’s Kynes,’ he said. ‘Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?’ He led her into step behind the procession.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘All else is most conventional,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And she thought: <em>My darling, can’t you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of
            escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">As they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table.
         A footman held his chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained
         standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Uneasy silence settled over the room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint <a id="page148"/>trembling at the corners of Leto’s mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. <em>What has angered him?</em> she asked herself. <em>Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,’ Leto said. ‘This is my way of telling you that many things will change.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Embarrassed silence settled over the table.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>They think him drunk,</em> Jessica thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Leto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor lights shot beams of reflection off it. ‘As a Chevalier of
         the Imperium, then,’ he said, ‘I give you a toast.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the sudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly
         in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke’s hawk features.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Here I am and here I remain!’ he barked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths – stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. ‘My toast is one
         of those maxims so dear to our hearts: “Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!” ’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He sipped his water.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gurney!’ the Duke called.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">From an alcove at Leto’s end of the room came Halleck’s voice. ‘Here, my Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Give us a tune, Gurney.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began putting plates of food on the table at the Duke’s
         gesture releasing them – roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich
         cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Still, the Duke remained standing.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">As the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: ‘In olden
         times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.’ His knuckles turned white, so fiercely did
         he grip <a id="page149"/>his water flagon. ‘I cannot sing, but I give you the words of Gurney’s song. Consider it another toast – a toast to all who’ve
         died bringing us to this station.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">An uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her – there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman,
         the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle-faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged
         and scar-faced Tuek, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Review, friends – troops long past review,’ the Duke intoned. ‘All to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear
         our silver collars. Review, friends – troops long past review. Each a dot of time without pretense or guile. With them passes
         the lure of fortune. Review, friends – troops long past review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we’ll pass the lure
         of fortune.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, slammed it back onto the
         table. Water slopped over the brim onto the linen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The others drank in embarrassed silence.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others
         around the table must do the same.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica was first to follow his example.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was
         studying the reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests’ actions revealed – especially among
         the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it
         exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions, nervous laughter … and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman
         dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetologist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath
         his jacket. He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast. He appeared
         completely unembarrassed by his action.
