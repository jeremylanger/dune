            never before seen. He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed the
            Guild and the evil old Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others.
            And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation to which even the most
            ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been aroused
            to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it, I
            think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad’Dib’s shared common
            ancestry.

      <p class="noindent">‘Now Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and darkened stilltent. As he spoke, he heard the vague
         stirrings of his mother where she slept against the tent’s opposite wall.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul glanced at the proximity detector on the floor, studying the dials illuminated in the blackness by phosphor tubes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It should be night soon,’ his mother said. ‘Why don’t you lift the tent shades?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul realized then that her breathing had been different for some time, that she had lain silent in the darkness until certain
         he was awake.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Lifting the shades wouldn’t help,’ he said. ‘There’s been a storm. The tent’s covered by sand. I’ll dig us out soon.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No sign of Duncan yet?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘None.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul rubbed absently at the ducal signet on his thumb, and a <a id="page228"/>sudden rage against the very substance of this planet which had helped kill his father set him trembling.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I heard the storm begin,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The undemanding emptiness of her words helped restore some of his calm. His mind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin
         through the transparent end of their stilltent – cold dribbles of sand crossing the basin, then runnels and tails furrowing
         the sky. He had looked up to a rock spire, seen it change shape under the blast, becoming a low, cheddar-colored wedge. Sand
         funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the tent was covered.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Tent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then – silence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their
         sand snorkel pumping air from the surface.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Try the receiver again,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No use,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He found his stillsuit’s watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he
         truly began an Arrakeen existence – living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was flat and tasteless water,
         but it soothed his throat.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst.
         To accept it would require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must guard even fractional
         traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tent’s catch-pockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">So much easier to drift back down into sleep.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But there had been a dream in this day’s sleep, and she shivered at memory of it. She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow
         where a name had been written: <em>Duke Leto Atreides.</em> The name had blurred with the sand and she had moved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The sand would not stop.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Her dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailing – part of her mind had realized the sound was her own
         voice as a tiny child, little more than a baby. A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page229"/><em>My unknown mother,</em> Jessica thought. <em>The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave me to the Sisters because that’s what she was commanded to do. Was she glad to rid
            herself of a Harkonnen child?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The place to hit them is in the spice,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>How can he think of attack at a time like this?</em> she asked herself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘An entire planet full of spice,’ she said. ‘How can you hit them there?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It was sea power and air power on Caladan,’ he said. ‘Here, it’s <em>desert power.</em> The Fremen are the key.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">His voice came from the vicinity of the tent’s sphincter. Her Bene Gesserit training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness
         toward her.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>All his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens,</em> she thought. <em>Now, he finds he is Harkonnen … because of me. How little he knows me! I was my Duke’s only woman. I accepted his life and
            his values even to defying my Bene Gesserit orders.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The tent’s glowtab came alight under Paul’s hand, filled the domed area with green radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter,
         his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open desert – forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted. Only his dark
         eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward her and away.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Secure yourself for the open,’ he said, and his voice was blurred behind the filter.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she watched Paul break the tent seal.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Sand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with
         a static compaction tool. A hole grew in the sand wall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and her ears followed
         his progress to the surface.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>What will we find out there?</em> she wondered. <em>Harkonnen troops and the Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we don’t know?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She thought of the compaction tool and the other strange <a id="page230"/>instruments in the pack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Pass up the pack.’ It was Paul’s voice, low and guarded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack across the floor. She peered upward, saw Paul framed
         against stars.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Here,’ he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Now she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed
         her patch of night. The meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger stripes, like luminous grave slats clabbering her
         blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hurry up,’ Paul said. ‘I want to collapse the tent.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand. <em>How much sand will the hand hold?</em> she asked herself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shall I help you?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static-packed sand rasp under her hands. Paul reached down, took
         her arm. She stood beside him on a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost brimmed their basin, leaving
         only a dim lip of surrounding rock. She probed the farther darkness with her trained senses.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Noise of small animals.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Birds.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul collapsed their tent, recovering it up the hole.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Starlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with menace. She looked at patches of blackness.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Black is a blind remembering,</em> she thought. <em>You listen for pack sounds, for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive
            cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, Paul stood beside her, said: ‘Duncan told me that if <a id="page231"/>he was captured, he could hold out … this long. We must leave here now.’ He shouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip
         of the basin, climbed to a ledge that looked down on open desert.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her son’s orbit.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>For now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas,</em> she thought. <em>This world has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose: tomorrow’s life. I live now for my young Duke and the daughter yet
            to be.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to Paul’s side.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked north across a line of rocks, studying a distant escarpment.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined by stars. The long swish of it lifted on an invisible
         wave with syllables of boomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi-shaped upthrusting at the stern.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">An orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple cut downward toward the glare.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another line of purple!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And another upthrusting orange glare!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was like an ancient naval battle, remembered shellfire, and the sight held them staring.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Pillars of fire,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock. Lines of purple laced the sky.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Jetflares and lasguns,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The dust-reddened first moon of Arrakis lifted above the horizon to their left and they saw a storm trail there – a ribbon
         of movement over the desert.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It must be Harkonnen ’thopters hunting us,’ Paul said. ‘The way they’re cutting up the desert … it’s as though they were
         making certain they stamped out whatever’s there … the way you’d stamp out a nest of insects.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Or a nest of Atreides,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We must seek cover,’ Paul said. ‘We’ll head south and keep to the rocks. If they caught us in the open …’ He turned, adjusting
         the pack to his shoulders. ‘They’re killing anything that moves.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He took one step along the ledge and, in that instant, <a id="page232"/>heard the low hiss of gliding aircraft, saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them.

      <p class="noindent">‘I’ve always prided myself on seeing things the way they truly are,’ Thufir Hawat said. ‘That’s the curse of being a Mentat.
         You can’t stop analyzing your data.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke. His sapho-stained lips were drawn into a straight
         line with radial creases spreading upward.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved by the words.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow sink. Dawn was spreading over the shattered outline
         of cliffs across the basin, touching everything with pink. It was cold under the overhang, a dry and penetrating chill left
         over from the night. There had been a warm wind just before dawn, but now it was cold. Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind
         him among the few troopers remaining in his force.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the sink in the first light of false dawn, skittering
         over the sand, blending into the dunes, his movements barely discernible.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there. It looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out
         of it. ‘There are many Harkonnen patrols,’ he said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the cliffs that Hawat and
         his men had descended.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat nodded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Many patrols. Yes.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">But still he did not know what this Fremen wanted and this rankled. Mentat training was supposed to give a man the power to
         see motives.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page233"/>This had been the worst night of Hawat’s life. He had been at Tsimpo, a garrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital
         city, Carthag, when the reports of attack began arriving. At first, he’d thought: <em>It’s a raid. The Harkonnens are testing.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">But report followed report – faster and faster.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Two legions landed at Carthag.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Five legions – fifty brigades! – attacking the Duke’s main base at Arrakeen.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A legion at Arsunt.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Two battle groups at Splintered Rock.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then the reports became more detailed – there were Imperial Sardaukar among the attackers – possibly two legions of them.
         And it became clear that the invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where. Precisely! Superb intelligence.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat’s shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning of his Mentat capabilities. The size of the attack
         struck his mind like a physical blow.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Now, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his torn and slashed tunic around him as though warding
         off the cold shadows.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The size of the attack.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the Guild for probing raids. That was an ordinary enough
         gambit in this kind of House-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to transport the spice for
         House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against random raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they’d expected
         no more than ten brigades.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">But there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last count – not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors,
         crushers, troop-carriers, dump-boxes …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">More than a hundred brigades – ten legions!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The entire spice income of Arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost of such a venture.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It <em>might.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I underestimated what the Baron was willing to spend in attacking us,</em> Hawat thought. <em>I failed my Duke.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then there was the matter of the traitor.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page234"/><em>I will live long enough to see her strangled!</em> he thought. <em>I should’ve killed that Bene Gesserit witch when I had the chance.</em> There was no doubt in his mind who had betrayed them – the Lady Jessica; She fitted all the facts available.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your man Gurney Halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler friends,’ the Fremen said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Good.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>So Gurney will get off this hell planet. We’re not all gone.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat glanced back at the huddle of his men. He had started the night just past with three hundred of his finest. Of those,
         an even twenty remained and half of them were wounded. Some of them slept now, standing up, leaning against the rock, sprawled
         on the sand beneath the rock. Their last ’thopter, the one they’d been using as a ground-effect machine to carry their wounded,
         had given out just before dawn. They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces, then worked their way down into this
         hiding place at the edge of the basin.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat had only a rough idea of their location – some two hundred kilometers southeast of Arrakeen. The main traveled ways
         between the Shield Wall sietch communities were somewhere south of them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal sandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight
         back from a high, thin forehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet. Beard and mustache were stained
         at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man removed his plugs, readjusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside his nose.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘If you cross the sink here this night,’ the Fremen said, ‘you must not use shields. There is a break in the wall …’ He turned
         on his heels, pointed south. ‘… there, and it is open sand down to the erg. Shields will attract a …’ He hesitated. ‘… worm.
         They don’t often come in here, but a shield will bring one every time.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He said worm,</em> Hawat thought. <em>He was going to say something else. What? And what does he want of us?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat sighed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page235"/>He could not recall ever before being this tired. It was a muscle weariness that energy pills were unable to ease.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Those damnable Sardaukar!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">With a self-accusing bitterness, he faced the thought of the soldier-fanatics and the Imperial treachery they represented.
         His own Mentat assessment of the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this treachery before
         the High Council of the Landsraad where justice might be done.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you wish to go to the smugglers?’ the Fremen asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is it possible?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The way is long.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘Fremen don’t like to say no,’</em> Idaho had told him once.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat said: ‘You haven’t told me whether your people can help my wounded.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They are wounded.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The same damned answer every time!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We know they’re wounded!’ Hawat snapped. ‘That’s not the—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Peace, friend,’ the Fremen cautioned. ‘What do your wounded say? Are there those among them who can see the water need of
         your tribe?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We haven’t talked about water,’ Hawat said. ‘We—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I can understand your reluctance,’ the Fremen said. ‘They are your friends, your tribesmen. Do you have water?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not enough.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen gestured to Hawat’s tunic, the skin exposed beneath it. ‘You were caught in-sietch, without your suits. You must
         make a water decision, friend.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Can we hire your help?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen shrugged. You have no water.’ He glanced at the group behind Hawat. ‘How many of your wounded would you spend?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat fell silent, staring at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their communication was out of phase. Word-sounds were
         not being linked up here in the normal manner.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am Thufir Hawat,’ he said. ‘I can speak for my Duke. I will make promissory commitment now for your help. I wish a <a id="page236"/>limited form of help, preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond vengeance.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You wish our siding in a vendetta?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The vendetta I’ll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility for my wounded that I may get about it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen scowled. ‘How can you be responsible for your wounded? They are their own responsibility. The water’s at issue,
         Thufir Hawat. Would you have me take that decision away from you?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat tensed, wondering: <em>Is this betrayal here?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What do you fear?’ the Fremen demanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>These people and their disconcerting directness!</em> Hawat spoke cautiously. ‘There’s a price on my head.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h-h-h.’ The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon. ‘You think we have the Byzantine corruption. You don’t know us. The
         Harkonnens have not water enough to buy the smallest child among us.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>But they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting ships,</em> Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We both fight Harkonnens,’ Hawat said. ‘Should we not share the problems and ways of meeting the battle issue?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We are sharing,’ the Fremen said. ‘I have seen you fight Harkonnens. You are good. There’ve been times I’d have appreciated
         your arm beside me.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Say where my arm may help you,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who knows?’ the Fremen asked. ‘There are Harkonnen forces everywhere. But you still have not made the water decision or put
         it to your wounded.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I must be cautious,</em> Hawat told himself. <em>There’s a thing here that’s not understood.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He said: ‘Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Stranger-thinking,’ the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone. He pointed to the northwest across the clifftop.
         ‘We watched you come across the sand last night.’ He lowered his arm. ‘You keep your force on the slipface of the dunes. Bad.
         You have no stillsuits, no water. You will not last long.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page237"/>‘The ways of Arrakis don’t come easily,’ Hawat said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Truth. But we’ve killed Harkonnens.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What do you do with your own wounded?’ Hawat demanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Does a man not know when he is worth saving?’ the Fremen asked. ‘Your wounded know you have no water.’ He tilted his head,
         looking sideways up at Hawat. ‘This is clearly a time for water decision. Both wounded and unwounded must look to the tribe’s
         future.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>The tribe’s future,</em> Hawat thought. <em>The tribe of Atreides. There’s sense in that.</em> He forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Have you word of my Duke or his son?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Unreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawat’s. ‘Word?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Their fate!’ Hawat snapped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Fate is the same for everyone,’ the Fremen said. ‘Your Duke, it is said, has met his fate. As to the Lisan al-Gaib, his son,
         that is in Liet’s hands. Liet has not said.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I knew the answer without asking,</em> Hawat thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He glanced back at his men. They were all awake now. They had heard. They were staring out across the sand, the realization
         in their expressions: there was no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat turned back to the Fremen. ‘Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He was in the great house when the shield went down,’ the Fremen said. ‘This I’ve heard … no more.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>She dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens,</em> he thought. <em>I was the one who sat with my back to a door. How could she do this when it meant turning against her own son? But … who knows
            how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks … if you can call it thinking?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. When will you hear about the boy?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We know little of what happens in Arrakeen,’ the Fremen said. He shrugged. ‘Who knows?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You have ways of finding out?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps.’ The Fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose. ‘Tell me, Thufir Hawat, do you have knowledge of the big weapons
         the Harkonnens used?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page238"/><em>The artillery,</em> Hawat thought bitterly. <em>Who could have guessed they’d use artillery in this day of shields?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves,’ he said. ‘I’ve … theoretical knowledge of such explosive
         weapons.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die,’ the Fremen said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why do you ask about these weapons?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Liet wishes it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Is that what he wants from us?</em> Hawat wondered. He said: ‘Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then you should just go take one,’ Hawat sneered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes,’ the Fremen said. ‘We took one. We have it hidden where Stilgar can study it for Liet and where Liet can see it for
         himself if he wishes. But I doubt he’ll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for Arrakis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You … took one?’ Hawat asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It was a good fight,’ the Fremen said. ‘We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>There were Sardaukar at every gun,</em> Hawat thought. <em>This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens,’ the Fremen said. ‘Some of those were
         good fighters.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">One of Hawat’s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. ‘Are you talking about Sardaukar?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s talking about Sardaukar,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sardaukar!’ the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice. ‘Ah-h-h, so that’s what they are! This was a good
         night indeed. Sardaukar. Which legion? Do you know?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We … don’t know,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sardaukar,’ the Fremen mused. Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is this not strange?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘But you</em> know they are Sardaukar.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who am I?’ Hawat asked bitterly.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page239"/>‘You are Thufir Hawat,’ the man said matter-of-factly. ‘Well, we would have learned it in time. We’ve sent three of them captive
         to be questioned by Liet’s men.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat’s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: ‘You … <em>captured</em> Sardaukar?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Only three of them,’ the Fremen said. ‘They fought well.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>If only we’d had the time to link up with these Fremen,</em> Hawat thought. It was a sour lament in his mind. <em>If only we could’ve trained them and armed them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we’d have had!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib,’ the Fremen said. ‘If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot
         touch him. Do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I serve the … Lisan al-Gaib,’ Hawat said. ‘His welfare is my concern. I’ve pledged myself to this.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You are pledged to his water?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his attention to the squatting figure. ‘To his water,
         yes.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘To … yes, to the place of his water.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?’ The Fremen stood up, seated his nose plugs firmly.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With a tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced
         conversation arise among the men.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen said: ‘There is always a way to water.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Behind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat’s aide called: ‘Thufir! Arkie just died.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen put a fist to his ear. ‘The bond of water! It’s a sign!’ He stared at Hawat. ‘We have a place nearby for accepting
         the water. Shall I call my men?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The aide returned to Hawat’s side, said: ‘Thufir, a couple of the men left wives in Arrakeen. They’re … well, you know how
         it is at a time like this.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen still held his fist to his ear. ‘Is it the bond of water, Thufir Hawat?’ he demanded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page240"/>Hawat’s mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen’s words, but feared the reaction of the tired men under
         the rock overhang when they understood it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The bond of water,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Let our tribes be joined,’ the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">As though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang,
         rolled the dead man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with him along the cliff wall to the right. Spurts of dust
         lifted around their running feet.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It was over before Hawat’s tired men could gather their wits. The group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding
         robe was gone around a turn in the cliff.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">One of Hawat’s men shouted: ‘Where they going with Arkie? He was—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’re taking him to … bury him,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Fremen don’t bury their dead!’ the man barked. ‘Don’t you try any tricks on us, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one
         of—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib,’ the Fremen said. ‘If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you
         serve, as you have said it, why raise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the
         memory of man endures.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Hawat’s men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a lasgun. He started to draw it.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Stop right where you are!’ Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles. ‘These people respect
         our dead. Customs differ, but the meaning’s the same.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’re going to render Arkie down for his water,’ the man with the lasgun snarled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?’ the Fremen asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He doesn’t even see the problem,</em> Hawat thought. The naïveté of the Fremen was frightening.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’re concerned for a respected comrade,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat <a id="page241"/>our own,’ the Fremen said. ‘This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man’s flesh is his own; the water belongs to the
         tribe.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. ‘Will you now help our wounded?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One does not question the bond,’ the Fremen said. We will do for you what a tribe does for its own. First, we must get all
         of you suited and see to the necessities.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man with the lasgun hesitated.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat’s aide said: ‘Are we buying help with Arkie’s … water?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not buying,’ Hawat said. ‘We’ve joined these people.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Customs differ,’ one of his men muttered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat began to relax.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And they’ll help us get to Arrakeen?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We will kill Harkonnens,’ the Fremen said. He grinned. ‘And Sardaukar.’ He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his
         ears and tipped his head back, listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: ‘An aircraft comes. Conceal yourselves beneath
         the rock and remain motionless.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">At a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen took Hawat’s arm, pressed him back with the others. ‘We will fight in the time of fighting,’ the man said. He reached
         beneath his robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue-within-blue eyes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over the animal’s head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall
         from his tongue into the bat’s upturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremen’s open hand. The man
         took a tiny tube, held it beside the bat’s head and chattered into the tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it
         upward.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent his head, listening. ‘They quarter the high country,’
         he said. ‘One wonders who they seek up there.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s known that we retreated this direction,’ Hawat said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt,’ <a id="page242"/>the Fremen said. ‘Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Time passed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Some of Hawat’s men stirred, whispering.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Remain silent as frightened animals,’ the Fremen hissed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff – flitting blurs of tan on tan.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My little friend carried his message,’ the Fremen said. ‘He is a good messenger – day or night. I’ll be unhappy to lose that
         one.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing
         pressure of the day’s heat – blurred columns of rising air.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Be most silent now,’ the Fremen whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff, headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared
         to be Fremen, but a curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A ‘thwok-thwok’ of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind Hawat’s group. The craft came over the cliff wall above
         them – an Atreides ’thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The ’thopter swooped toward the men crossing the
         sink.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The ’thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men
         swarmed from the ’thopter and Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of shields and, in their motions, the hard competence
         of Sardaukar.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Aiihh! They use their stupid shields,’ the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They are Sardaukar,’ Hawat whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Good.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half-circle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen
         stood in a compact group, apparently indifferent.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page243"/>Abruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the ornithopter, then in it. Where the two groups had
         met at the dune crest, a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They left only three men in their ’thopter,’ the Fremen beside Hawat said. ‘That was fortunate. I don’t believe we had to
         damage the craft in taking it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Behind Hawat, one of his men whispered: ‘Those were Sardaukar!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Did you notice how well they fought?’ the Fremen asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Hawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness,
         he said: ‘Yes, they fought well, indeed.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The captured ’thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>So these Fremen can handle ’thopters, too,</em> Hawat thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">On the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once … twice.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘More come!’ the Fremen beside Hawat barked. ‘Be ready. I’d hoped to have us away without more inconvenience.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Inconvenience!</em> Hawat thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He saw two more ’thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight
         splotches of blue – the bodies of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms – remained at the scene of violence.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another ’thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a sharp breath as he saw it – a big troop carrier.
         It flew with the slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load – like a giant bird coming to its nest.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving ’thopters. It laced across the sand, raising
         a sharp trail of dust.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The cowards!’ the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue-clad bodies. Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action

      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page244"/>Hawat’s attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a ’thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded
         flat against its sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the sky. It plunged like an arrow toward
         the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving ’thopter
         plunged.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the
         sand where the carrier and its companion ’thopters had been – everything there caught in the flame.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It was the Fremen who took off in that captured ’thopter,</em> Hawat thought. <em>He deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What</em> are <em>these Fremen?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A reasonable exchange,’ said the Fremen beside Hawat. ‘There must’ve been three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must
         see to their water and make plans to get another aircraft.’ He started to step out of their rock-shadowed concealment.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant,
         Hawat had time to see that they were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and each carried
         a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A thrown knife caught Hawat’s Fremen companion in the throat, hurling him backward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time
         to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.

      <p class="noindent">As the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his mother’s arm, snapped: ‘Don’t move!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands
         at the controls.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s Idaho,’ he breathed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest. Idaho was out of his ’thopter and
         running toward them before the dust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the tall, sandy-bearded
         Kynes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This way!’ Kynes called and he veered left.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Behind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Idaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. ‘M’Lord, the Fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What about that back there?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff – the jetflares, the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A rare smile touched Idaho’s round, placid face. ‘M’Lord … Sire, I’ve left them a little sur—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Glaring white light filled the desert – bright as a sun, etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping
         motion, Idaho had Paul’s arm in one hand, Jessica’s shoulder in the other, hurling them down off the ledge into the basin.
         They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock
         ledge they had vacated.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Idaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not the family atomics!’Jessica said. ‘I thought—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You planted a shield back there,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A big one turned to full force,’ Idaho said. ‘A lasgun beam touched it and …’ He shrugged.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page246"/>‘Subatomic fusion,’Jessica said. ‘That’s a dangerous weapon.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not weapon, m’Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using lasguns another time.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low voice: ‘We should get under cover, friends.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That blast <em>will</em> attract considerable attention, Sire,’ Idaho said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Sire,</em> Paul thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been his father.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was
         moving the human universe toward chaos. ‘The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him along the edge of the
         basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘May I take your pack, Sire?’ Idaho asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s not heavy, Duncan,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You have no body shield,’ Idaho said. ‘Do you wish mine?’ He glanced at the distant cliff. ‘Not likely there’ll be any more
         lasgun activity about.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Keep your shield, Duncan. Your right arm is shield enough for me.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul, and she thought: <em>Such a sure hand my son has with his people.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover
         was rigged for the opening.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This way,’ one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into darkness.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Behind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a
         turn to the left. Robed Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner, found another down-slanting
         passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back, the neck <a id="page247"/>of his stillsuit glistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue eyes without whites were a darkness
         under heavy brows.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: <em>Why am I helping these people? It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done. It could doom me with them.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except
         the position that now must be assumed – the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely
         because of this youth – and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the Bene Gesserit way – a laboratory, a civil place
         full of angles and squares in the ancient manner.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as advance bases,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>His father wanted!</em> Kynes thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And again Kynes wondered at himself. <em>Am I foolish to aid these fugitives? Why am I doing it? It’d be so easy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust with
            them.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul followed his mother’s example, gestalting the room, seeing the workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock.
         Instruments lined the bench – dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them. An ozone smell permeated
         the place.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Some of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds started there – machine coughs, the whinnies
         of spinning belts and multidrives.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them stacked against the wall.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’ve recognized this place correctly,’ Kynes said. ‘For what would you use such a place, Paul Atreides?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘To make this planet a fit place for humans,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Perhaps that’s why I help them,</em> Kynes thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was
         cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page248"/>Paul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the
         side wall across the cages.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: ‘Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working.
         I am unable to mask us from proximity detectors.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Can you repair it?’ Kynes asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not quickly. The parts …’ The man shrugged.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes,’ Kynes said. ‘Then we’ll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air out to the surface.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Immediately.’ The man hurried away.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes turned back to Paul. ‘You gave a good answer.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica marked the easy rumble of the man’s voice. It was a <em>royal</em> voice, accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other
         face of the tame planetologist.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’re most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mm-m-m, we’ll see,’ Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. ‘Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘At once, Liet,’ the man said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes indicated an arched opening in a side wall of the chamber. ‘If you please?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard
         here.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square office lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed
         her hand across the door as she entered, was startled to identify plasteel.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He heard the door close behind him, studied the place
         – about eight meters to a side, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on their right. A low
         desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied the room’s center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting the way her son examined the room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page249"/>Paul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the room’s air currents told him there was a secret exit to
         their right behind the filing cabinets.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?’ Kynes asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>How carefully he avoids my title,</em> Paul thought. But he accepted the chair, remained silent while Kynes sat down.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise,’ Kynes said. ‘Yet, as you see, the Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen,
         its seekers after the spice!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul held up his thumb with its ducal signet. ‘Do you see this ring?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you know its significance?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica turned sharply to stare at her son.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen,’ Kynes said. ‘You are technically the Duke.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m a soldier of the Imperium,’ Paul said, <em>‘technically</em> a hatchetman.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes’ face darkened. ‘Even with the Emperor’s Sardaukar standing over your father’s body?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: <em>There’s steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of … and we’ve need of steel. Paul’s doing a dangerous thing.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul said: ‘The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved Emperor feared my father. Now, <em>I</em> will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear the—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Lad,’ Kynes said, ‘there are things you don’t—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You will address me as Sire or my Lord,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Gently,</em> Jessica thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the planetologist’s face, the touch of humor there.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sire,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am an embarrassment to the Emperor,’ Paul said. ‘I am an embarrassment to all who would divide Arrakis as their spoil.
         As <a id="page250"/>I live, I shall continue to be such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Words,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: ‘You have a legend of the Lisan al-Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the
         one who will lead the Fremen to paradise. Your men have—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Superstition!’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps,’ Paul agreed. Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You have a plan,’ Kynes said. ‘This much is obvious … <em>Sire.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are here in Harkonnen uniform?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Quite likely.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here,’ Paul said. ‘Perhaps even Beast Rabban. Let him. Once he has involved
         himself beyond escaping his guilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before the Landsraad.
         Let him answer there where—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Paul!’ said Jessica.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case,’ Kynes said, ‘there could be only one outcome: general warfare
         between the Imperium and the Great Houses.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Chaos,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But I’d present my case to the Emperor,’ Paul said, ‘and give him an alternative to chaos.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica spoke in a dry tone: ‘Blackmail?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One of the tools of statecraft, as you’ve said yourself,’ Paul said, and Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. ‘The
         Emperor has no sons, only daughters.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’d aim for the throne?’Jessica asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium shattered by total war,’ Paul said. ‘Planets blasted, disorder everywhere –
         he’ll not risk that.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is a desperate gamble you propose,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?’ Paul asked. ‘They fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis
         – the Sardaukar picking them off one by one. That’s <a id="page251"/>why there <em>is</em> a Landsraad. This is the glue of the Great Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But they’re—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is what they fear,’ Paul said. ‘Arrakis would become a rallying cry. Each of them would see himself in my father – cut
         out of the herd and killed.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes spoke to Jessica: ‘Would his plan work?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m no Mentat,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But you are Bene Gesserit.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She shot a probing stare at him, said: ‘His plan has good points and bad points … as any plan would at this stage. A plan
         depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘“Law is the ultimate science,” ‘Paul quoted. ‘Thus it reads above the Emperor’s door. I propose to show him law.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And I’m not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan,’ Kynes said. ‘Arrakis has its own plan that we—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘From the throne,’ Paul said, ‘I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the wave of a hand. This is the coin I offer for your
         support.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes stiffened. ‘My loyalty’s not for sale, <em>Sire.’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those blue-within-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the
         commanding appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul’s lips and he said: ‘Well spoken. I apologize.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes met Paul’s stare and, presently, said: ‘No Harkonnen ever admitted error. Perhaps you’re not like them, Atreides.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It could be a fault in their education,’ Paul said. ‘You say you’re not for sale, but I believe I’ve the coin you’ll accept.
         For your loyalty I offer <em>my</em> loyalty to you … totally.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>My son has the Atreides sincerity,</em> Jessica thought. <em>He has that tremendous, almost naive honor – and what a powerful force that truly is.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She saw that Paul’s words had shaken Kynes.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is nonsense,’ Kynes said. ‘You’re just a boy and—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m the Duke,’ Paul said. ‘I’m an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken such a bond.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes swallowed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘When I say totally,’ Paul said, ‘I mean without reservation. I would give my life for you.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page252"/>‘Sire!’ Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but
         to a man, to a superior. Now Kynes meant the word.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>In this moment he’d give his life for Paul,</em> she thought. <em>How do the Atreides accomplish this so quickly, so easily?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I know you mean this,’ Kynes said. ‘Yet the Harkon—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling violence – shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing
         in the passage.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">With his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking the passage, his blood-pitted eyes there visible
         through a shield blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield. There was the orange fire-mouth
         of a stunner repelled by the shield. Idaho’s blades were through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Then Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen uniforms – his jerking, controlled staggers, the
         black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I appear to’ve decided,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down,’ Paul said. He pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair
         in her eyes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I should’ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’ve a bolt hole out of here,’ Paul said. ‘Shall we use it?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes took a deep breath, said: ‘This door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’ll not use a lasgun for fear we’ve shields on this side,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform,’ Jessica whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes indicated the cabinets against the right-hand wall, said: ‘This way.’ He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer,
         manipulated a handle within it. The entire wall of cabinets <a id="page253"/>swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel. ‘This door also is plasteel,’ Kynes said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You were well prepared,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years,’ Kynes said. He herded them into the darkness, closed the door.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Kynes’ voice came from behind them: ‘We’ll separate here. This wall is tougher. It’ll stand for at least an hour. Follow the
         arrows like that one on the floor. They’ll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to another exit where
         I’ve secreted a ’thopter. There’s a storm across the desert tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the
         top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing ’thopters. If you stay high in the storm you’ll survive.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What of you?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll try to escape another way. If I’m captured … well, I’m still Imperial Planetologist. I can say I was your captive.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Running like cowards,</em> Paul thought. <em>But how else can I live to avenge my father?</em> He turned to face the door.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica heard him move, said: ‘Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll take full payment for them all one day,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Not unless you hurry now,’ Kynes said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul felt the man’s hand on his shoulder.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Where will we meet, Kynes?’ Paul asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll send the Fremen searching for you. The storm’s path is known. Hurry now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica found Paul’s hand, pulled him gently. ‘We must not get separated,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They were running now.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page254"/><em>Plans within plans within plans within plans,</em> Jessica thought. <em>Have we become part of someone else’s plan now?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in the faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward
         for a time, then up, ever up. They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing wall with a
         dark handle visible in its center.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul pressed the handle.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern with an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat
         gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Where did Kynes go?’Jessica asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He did what any good guerrilla leader would,’ Paul said. ‘He separated us into two parties and arranged that he couldn’t
         reveal where we are if he’s captured. He won’t really know.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No one’s been here for a long time,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He seemed confident the Fremen could find us,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I share that confidence.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter’s left door, opened it, and secured his pack in the rear. ‘This ship’s
         proximity masked,’ he said. ‘Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty years under the Harkonnens taught
         them to be thorough.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica leaned against the craft’s other side, catching her breath.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area,’ she said. ‘They’re not stupid.’ She considered her direction sense,
         pointed right. ‘The storm we saw is that way.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause, but found no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this
         night he had passed a decision-nexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding them, but the here-and-now existed
         as a place of mystery. It was as though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a valley. Of the countless
         paths up out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page255"/>‘The longer we wait the better prepared they’ll be,’ Jessica said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Get in and strap yourself down,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this was <em>blind</em> ground, unseen in any prescient vision. And he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been giving more and more
         reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.’ It was a Bene Gesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising
         never again to fall into that trap … if he lived through this.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked the aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest,
         their delicate metal interleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten for jet-boost take-off
         the way Gurney Halleck had taught him. The starter switch moved easily. Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods
         were armed. Turbines began their low hissing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ready?’ he asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He touched the remote control for lights.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Darkness blanketed them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">His hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote door control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade
         of sand swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul’s cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the door-wall had been. Starlight defined a shelf
         beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The wings snapped back and down, hurling the ’thopter out
         of its nest. Power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the sureness of her son’s movements. She was frightened,
         yet exhilarated. <em>Now, Paul’s training is our only hope,</em> she thought. <em>His youth and swiftness.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page256"/>Paul fed more power to the jetpods. The ’thopter banked, sinking them into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars
         ahead. He gave the craft more wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over rocks, silver-frosted
         angles and outcroppings in the starlight. The dust-reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining
         the ribbon trail of the storm.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul’s hands danced over the controls. Wings snicked in to beetle stubs. G-force pulled at their flesh as the craft came around
         in a tight bank.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Jetflares behind us!’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I saw them.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He slammed the power arm forward.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Their ’thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the storm and the great curve of desert. In the near
         distance, Paul saw scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking beneath the dunes.
         Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows – dunes diminishing one into another.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Something jarred the ’thopter.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Shellburst!’ Jessica gasped. ‘They’re using some kind of projectile weapon.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She saw a sudden animal grin on Paul’s face. ‘They seem to be avoiding their lasguns,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But we’ve no shields!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do they know that?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again the ’thopter shuddered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul twisted to peer back. ‘Only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry – that’s one thing we’ll give the Fremen,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The storm,’Jessica said. ‘Hadn’t you better turn?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What about the ship behind us?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s pulling up.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page257"/>‘Now!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the
         G-force.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the
         moon. The aircraft became a long, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Through Jessica’s mind flashed all the warnings about such storms – that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone
         and ate away the bones. She felt the buffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul fought the controls. She saw
         him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and trembled.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sand!’Jessica shouted.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. ‘Not much sand this high.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments,
         gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The sound of their passage diminished.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The ’thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft
         back to level flight.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion was external. A vague tan flowing against the
         windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour,</em> she thought. Adrenalin edginess gnawed at her. <em>I must not fear,</em> she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany. <em>Fear is the mind-killer.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Slowly her long years of training prevailed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Calmness returned.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We have the tiger by the tail,’ Paul whispered. ‘We can’t go down, can’t land … and I don’t think I can lift us out of this.
         We’ll have to ride it out.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Calmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, <a id="page258"/>clamped them together. Then she heard Paul’s voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to
         pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will
         be nothing. Only I will remain.’

      <p class="noindent">‘They are dead, Baron,’ said Iakin Nefud, the guard captain. ‘Both the woman and the boy are certainly dead.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his private quarters. Beyond these quarters and enclosing him
         like a multishelled egg stretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis. Here in his quarters, though, the ship’s harsh
         metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric paddings and rare art objects.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It is a certainty,’ the guard captain said. ‘They are dead.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors, focused his attention on an ebaline statue of a leaping boy in a niche
         across the room. Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across
         the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’re certainly dead, Baron,’ the man repeated.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud’s eyes. It was obvious the man had been deep within the drug’s rapture
         when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I have a full report,’ Nefud said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Let him sweat a little,</em> the Baron thought. <em>One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear – sharp and ready.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Have you seen their bodies?’ the Baron rumbled.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Nefud hesitated.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Well?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord … they were seen to dive into a sandstorm … <a id="page259"/>winds over eight hundred kilometers. Nothing survives such a storm, m’Lord. Nothing! One of our own craft was destroyed in
         the pursuit.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of the man’s jaw muscles, the way the chin moved
         as Nefud swallowed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You have seen the bodies?’ the Baron asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?’ the Baron roared. ‘To tell me a thing is certain when it is not?
         Do you think I’ll praise you for such stupidity, give you another promotion?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Nefud’s face went bone pale.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Look at that chicken,</em> the Baron thought. <em>I am surrounded by such useless clods. If I scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he’d peck at it.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The man Idaho led us to them, then?’ the Baron asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, m’Lord!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Look how he blurts out his answer,</em> the Baron thought. He said: ‘They were attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is there more to this … report?’</p>

      <p class="indent">‘They … ah, fled together to a place in the desert where it’s apparent the boy and his mother were hiding. In the excitement

      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord, the Sardaukar have … two persons in custody who might be of interest to you. They’ve caught the Duke’s Master of

      <p class="indent">‘This is a Mentat you speak of,’ the Baron growled. ‘One doesn’t waste a Mentat. Has he spoken? What does he say of his defeat?

      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord, Hawat’s still in the hands of the Sardaukar!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes. Indeed, yes. But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information from Hawat as I am. I’ve noticed a thing about
         our allies, Nefud. They’re not very devious … politically. I do believe this is a deliberate thing; the Emperor wants it that
         way. Yes. I do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Nefud looked unhappy. ‘Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You will tell the Sardaukar commander that I wish to question both Hawat and this Kynes at the same time, playing one off
         against the other. He can understand that much, I think.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And once we have them in our hands …’ The Baron nodded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any … questioning.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers, Nefud.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand, m’Lord. That’s when Kynes can have his accident.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will have a real accident. It’s Hawat I want. Ah, yes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Nefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hawat will be given both food and drink,’ the Baron said. ‘Treated with kindness, with sympathy. In his water you will administer
         the residual poison developed by the late Piter de Vries. <em>And you</em> will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of Hawat’s diet from this point on … unless I say otherwise.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The antidote, yes.’ Nefud shook his head. ‘But—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Don’t be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule tooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence <a id="page262"/>deprived me of my most valuable Mentat, Piter. I need a replacement.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hawat?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hawat.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’re going to say Hawat’s completely loyal to the Atreides. True, but the Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be
         convinced he’s not to blame for the Duke’s demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an inferior master,
         one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud. We will woo the formidable
         Thufir Hawat.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Woo him. Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of
         reasoning that are a Mentat’s right. Hawat will see a certain element of truth in this. The Duke couldn’t afford the most
         efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required information.’ The Baron stared at Nefud. ‘Let us never deceive ourselves,
         Nefud. The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘With wealth. Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We will woo Hawat,’ the Baron said. ‘We will hide him from the Sardaukar. And we will hold in reserve … the withdrawal of
         the antidote for the poison. There’s no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud, Hawat need never suspect. The antidote
         will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Nefud’s eyes opened wide with understanding.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The absence of a thing,’ the Baron said, ‘this can be as deadly as the <em>presence.</em> The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything else we’re addicted to.’ The Baron nodded. You understand
         me, Nefud?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Nefud swallowed. Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘At once, m’Lord.’ Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page263"/><em>Hawat by my side!</em> the Baron thought. <em>The Sardaukar will give him to me. If they suspect anything at all it’s that I wish to destroy the Mentat. And this suspicion
            I’ll confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all history, a Mentat trained to kill, and they’ll toss him
            to me like some silly toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his suspensor bed, pressed a button to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat
         back, smiling.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>And all the Atreides dead!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis.
         Not an ornithopter … or its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right places, the <em>unthinkable</em> expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet … all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor’s ears
         alone, all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Power and fear —fear and power!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins.
         But a Harkonnen. Not this Rabban he’d summoned, of course. But Rabban’s younger brother, young Feyd-Rautha. There was a sharpness
         to the boy that the Baron enjoyed … a ferocity.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A lovely boy,</em> the Baron thought. <em>A year or two more – say, by the time he’s seventeen, I’ll know for certain whether he’s the tool that House Harkonnen requires
            to gain the throne.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord Baron.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron’s bedchamber was low built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen
         paternal line’s narrow-set eyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some rigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the
         eye that he’d come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>A muscle-minded tank-brain,</em> the Baron thought. <em>No Mentat, my nephew … not a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely</em> <a id="page264"/><em>devised for the task at hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he’ll grind over everything in his path. Oh, how he’ll be hated
            here on Arrakis!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘My dear Rabban,’ the Baron said. He released the door-field, but pointedly kept his body shield at full strength, knowing
         that the shimmer of it would be visible above the bedside glowglobe.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You summoned me,’ Rabban said. He stepped into the room, flicked a glance past the air disturbance of the body shield, searched
         for a suspensor chair, found none.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Stand closer where I can see you easily,’ the Baron said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to
         stand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Atreides are dead,’ the Baron said. ‘The last of them. That’s why I summoned you here to Arrakis. This planet is again
         yours.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban blinked. ‘But I thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to the—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Piter, too, is dead.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Piter?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Piter.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy penetration.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You finally tired of him, eh?’ Rabban asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">His voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy-blanketed room.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I will say a thing to you just this once,’ the Baron rumbled. ‘You insinuate that I obliterated Piter as one obliterates
         a trifle.’ He snapped fat fingers. ‘Just like that, eh? I am not so stupid, Nephew. I will take it unkindly if ever again
         you suggest by word or action that I am so stupid.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Fear showed in the squinting of Rabban’s eyes. He knew within certain limits how far the old Baron would go against family.
         Seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments could be painful.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Forgive me, m’Lord Baron,’ Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You do not fool me, Rabban,’ the Baron said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page265"/>Rabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I make a point,’ the Baron said. ‘Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some <em>due process of law.</em> Always do it for an overriding purpose – and <em>know your purpose!’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Anger spoke in Rabban: ‘But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! I saw his body being carried out as I arrived last night.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">But the Baron smiled. ‘I’m very careful about dangerous weapons,’ he said. ‘Doctor Yueh was a traitor. He gave me the Duke.’
         Strength poured into the Baron’s voice.’ <em>I</em> suborned a doctor of the Suk School! The <em>Inner</em> School! You hear, boy? But that’s a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. I didn’t obliterate him casually.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>That was a penetrating question,</em> the Baron thought. <em>Have I misjudged this nephew?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Emperor doesn’t know it yet,’ the Baron said. ‘But his Sardaukar are sure to report it to him. Before that happens, though,
         I’ll have my own report in his hands through CHOAM Company channels. I will explain that I <em>luckily</em> discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning. A false doctor, you understand? Since everyone <em>knows</em> you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk School, this will be accepted.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h-h, I see,’ Rabban murmured.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And the Baron thought: <em>Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret.</em> The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. <em>Why did I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine – the nephew I must use and discard?</em> The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It must be kept secret,’ Rabban said. ‘I understand.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron sighed. ‘I give you different instructions about Arrakis this time, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, I held
         you in strong rein. This time, I have only one requirement.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Income.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Income?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page266"/>‘Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first
         inkling of how much the Guild charges for military transport?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Expensive, eh?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Expensive!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. ‘If you squeeze Arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years, you’ll just
         barely repay us!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Expensive,’ the Baron sneered. ‘The damnable Guild monopoly on space would’ve ruined us if I hadn’t planned for this expense
         long ago. You should know, Rabban, that <em>we</em> bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of the Sardaukar.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a day when the Guild might be circumvented. They were
         insidious – bleeding off just enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where they could force
         you to pay and pay and pay.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Always, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. ‘Hazard rates,’ the oily Guild agents explained. And for every
         agent you managed to insert as a watchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Insufferable!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Income, then,’ Rabban said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. ‘You must squeeze.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And I may do anything I wish as long as I squeeze?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Anything.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The cannons you brought,’ Rabban said. ‘Could I—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m removing them,’ the Baron said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But you—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You won’t need such toys. They were a special innovation and are now useless. We need the metal. They cannot go against a
         shield, Rabban. They were merely the unexpected. It was predictable that the Duke’s men would retreat into cliff caves on
         this abominable planet. Our cannon merely sealed them in.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Fremen don’t use shields.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You may keep some lasguns if you wish.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page267"/>‘Yes, m’Lord. And I have a free hand.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As long as you squeeze.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban’s smile was gloating. ‘I understand perfectly, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You understand nothing perfectly,’ the Baron growled. ‘Let us have that clear at the outset. What you <em>do</em> understand is how to carry out my orders. Has it occurred to you, Nephew, that there are at least five million persons on
         this planet?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Does m’Lord forget that I was his regent-siridar here before? And if m’Lord will forgive me, his estimate may be low. It’s
         difficult to count a population scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here. And when you consider the Fremen of—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Fremen aren’t worth considering!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Forgive me, m’Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew. You know something?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord had retired when I arrived last night. I … ah, took the liberty of contacting some of my lieutenants from … ah, before.
         They’ve been acting as guides to the Sardaukar. They report that a Fremen band ambushed a Sardaukar force somewhere southeast
         of here and wiped it out.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Wiped out a Sardaukar force?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Impossible!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban shrugged.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Fremen defeating Sardaukar,’ the Baron sneered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I repeat only what was reported to me,’ Rabban said. ‘It is said this Fremen force already had captured the Duke’s redoubtable
         Thufir Hawat.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h-h-h-h-h.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron nodded, smiling.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I believe the report,’ Rabban said. ‘You’ve no idea what a problem the Fremen were.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps, but these weren’t Fremen your lieutenants saw. They must’ve been Atreides men trained by Hawat and disguised as
         Fremen. It’s the only possible answer.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, Rabban shrugged. ‘Well, the Sardaukar think they <a id="page268"/>were Fremen. The Sardaukar already have launched a pogrom to wipe out all Fremen.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Good!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’ll keep the Sardaukar occupied. And we’ll soon have Hawat. I know it! I can feel it! Ah, this has been a day! The Sardaukar
         off hunting a few useless desert bands while we get the real prize!’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘M’Lord …’ Rabban hesitated, frowning. ‘I’ve always felt that we underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ignore them, boy! They’re rabble. It’s the populous towns, cities, and villages that concern us. A great many people there,
         eh?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A great many, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They worry me, Rabban.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Worry you?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Oh … ninety per cent of them are of no concern. But there are always a few … Houses Minor and so on, people of ambition who
         might try a dangerous thing. If one of them should get off Arrakis with an unpleasant story about what happened here, I’d
         be most displeased. Have you any idea how displeased I’d be?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban swallowed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor,’ the Baron said. ‘As far as anyone off Arrakis
         must learn, this was straightforward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand? The Duke was
         offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept,
         though. That is the story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As the Emperor wishes it,’ Rabban said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘As the Emperor wishes it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What about the smugglers?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At any rate, you’ll be spreading some bribes in
         that quarter … and taking other measures which I’m sure you can think of.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page269"/>‘Yes, m’Lord.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You must show no mercy here. Think of these clods as
         what they are – slaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel. Not the slightest vestige of pity
         or mercy must you show them.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Can one exterminate an entire planet?’ Rabban asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Exterminate?’ Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron’s head. ‘Who said anything about exterminating?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I said <em>squeeze,</em> Nephew, not exterminate. Don’t waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore,
         my boy.’ He smiled, a baby’s expression in the dimple-fat face. ‘A carnivore never stops. Show no mercy. Never stop. Mercy
         is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst. You must be always hungry
         and thirsty.’ The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. ‘Like me.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I see, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban swung his gaze left and right.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s all clear then, Nephew?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Except for one thing, Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah, yes, Kynes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He’s the Emperor’s man, m’Lord. He can come and go as he pleases. And he’s very close to the Fremen … married one.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Kynes will be dead by tomorrow’s nightfall.’</p>

      <p class="indent">‘How do you think I’ve come this far this quickly?’ the Baron demanded. His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives.
         ‘Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You’re forgetting that he’s addicted to the spice.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Of course!’</p>

      <p class="indent"><a id="page270"/>Presently, the Baron said: ‘Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of your first concerns. I’ve quite a stockpile of
         private stuff, but that suicide raid by the Duke’s men got most of what we’d stored for sale.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Rabban nodded. ‘Yes, m’Lord.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The Baron brightened. ‘Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains of organization here and you’ll say to them:

      <p class="noindent">As Paul fought the ’thopter’s controls he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat
         awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of turbulence, an occasional
         vortex.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared
         featureless, but his inner sense began to <em>see</em> through the curtain.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>I must find the right vortex,</em> he thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">For a long time now he had sensed the storm’s power diminishing, but still it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page271"/>The vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul defied all fear to bank the ’thopter left.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Paul!’ she screamed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the ’thopter like a chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out – a winged
         speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them, saw the dying storm trailing away like
         a dry river into the desert – moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’re out of it,’Jessica whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We’ve given them the slip,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they
         had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime.
         She felt reborn.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>It was like the litany,</em> she thought. <em>We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It’s gone, but we remain.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I don’t like the sound of our wing motion,’ Paul said. ‘We suffered some damage in there.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They were out of the storm, but still not out into
         the full view of his prescient vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He shivered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness.
         Part of it, he felt, was the spice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the litany, as though the
         words had a power of their own.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>‘I shall not fear</em> …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Cause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and <a id="page272"/>he felt himself poised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the litany’s magic.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Words from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: <em>‘What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?’</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s rock all around,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul focused on the ’thopter’s launching, shook his head to clear it. He looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock
         shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in the cabin. There was
         a hole somewhere, more of the storm’s doing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Better set us down on sand,’ Jessica said. ‘The wings might not take full brake.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes. ‘I’ll set us down near those
         rocks. Check your safety harness.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She obeyed, thinking: <em>We’ve water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can
            do we can do.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Run for those rocks the instant we’re stopped,’ Paul said. ‘I’ll take the pack.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Run for …’ She fell silent, nodded. ‘Worms.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Our friends, the worms,’ he corrected her. ‘They’ll get this ’thopter. There’ll be no evidence of where we landed.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>How direct his thinking,</em> she thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They glided lower … lower …</p>
      
      <p class="indent">There came a rushing sense of motion to their passage – blurred shadows of dunes, rocks lifting like islands. The ’thopter
         touched a dune top with a soft lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>He’s killing our speed against the sand,</em> Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Brace yourself!’ Paul warned.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder. He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping
         faster and faster. Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings’ leaves.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Abruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left <a id="page273"/>wing, weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the ’thopter. The craft skidded across a dune
         top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They
         lay stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother, wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them
         into the cabin, bringing a dry smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother was free of her
         harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and out onto the ’thopter’s metal skin. Paul followed, dragging
         the pack by its straps.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Run!’ he ordered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica leaped off the ’thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune. She heard Paul’s panting progress behind. They
         came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Follow the ridge,’ Paul ordered. ‘It’ll be faster.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Worm,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It grew louder.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Faster!’ Paul gasped.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch
         and shatter behind them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped his side as he ran. He took his mother’s arm
         with his other hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel.
         Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I can’t run any farther,’Jessica panted.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert. A mound-in-motion ran parallel <a id="page274"/>to their rock island – moonlit ripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul’s eyes at a distance of about
         a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once – a short loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned
         their wrecked ornithopter.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Where the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">The burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’s bigger than a Guild spaceship,’ Paul whispered. ‘I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but I didn’t realize
         … how big.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Nor I,’Jessica breathed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Again, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curving track toward the horizon. They listened until the
         sound of its passage was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon-frosted escarpment, and quoted from the Kitab al-Ibar: ‘Travel by night and
         rest in black shade through the day.’ He looked at his mother. ‘We still have a few hours of night. Can you go on?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘In a moment.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps. He stood a moment with a paracompass
         in his hands.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Whenever you’re ready,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. ‘Which direction?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Where this ridge leads.’ He pointed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Deep into the desert,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Fremen desert,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">And he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient vision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen
         this desert. But the <em>set</em> of the vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared into his consciousness, been absorbed
         by memory, and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision <a id="page275"/>appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Idaho was with us in the vision,</em> he remembered. <em>But now Idaho is dead.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you see a way to go?’ Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No,’ he said, ‘but we’ll go anyway.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a sand-carved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto
         a moonlit floor of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and particular – the sand pockets between rocks where
         their steps were slowed, the wind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go over or go around?
         The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Careful here – this ledge is slippery with sand.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Watch you don’t hit your head against this overhang.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Stay below this ridge; the moon’s at our backs and it’d show our movement to anyone out there.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard Paul pulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed
         water. It tasted brackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan – a tall fountain enclosing a curve of sky, such a richness
         of moisture that it hadn’t been noticed for itself … only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside
         it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>To stop,</em> she thought. <em>To rest … truly rest.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page276"/>Paul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping surface. Jessica followed with a sigh.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">They slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face. Again, they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement
         across this broken land.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in substances beneath their feet and hands – boulders or
         pea gravel or flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and pea gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill
         the unwary. Rock flakes cut.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled into him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a
         static ocean some two hundred meters below. It lay there full of moon-silvered waves – shadows of angles that lapsed into
         curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of another escarpment.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Open desert,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘A wide place to cross,’ Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter trap across his face.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica glanced left and right – nothing but sand below.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of shadows in the moon’s passage. ‘About three or
         four kilometers across,’ he said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Worms,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Sure to be.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. ‘Shall we rest and eat?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank
         to the rock beside him. She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Here,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page277"/>His hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her palm.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Drink all your water,’ Paul said. ‘Axiom: the best place to conserve your water is in your body. It keeps your energy up.
         You’re stronger. Trust your stillsuit.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their
         tiredness, and she recalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, ‘Better a dry morsel and quietness therewith
         than a house full of sacrifice and strife.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica repeated the words to Paul.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That was Gurney,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead, thought: <em>And well poor Gurney might be dead.</em> The Atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themelves in this waterless void.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Gurney always had the right quotation,’ Paul said. ‘I can hear him now: “And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land
         into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers.”’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in her son’s voice.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, Paul said: ‘How do you … feel?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: ‘Your sister won’t be born for many months yet. I still
         feel … physically adequate.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">And she thought: <em>How stiffly formal I speak to my own son!</em> Then, because it was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she searched and found the source
         of her formality: <em>I’m afraid of my son; I fear his strangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds of the night. His lungs were charged with his
         own silence. His nose itched. He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s melange spice nearby,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page278"/>An eider wind feathered Paul’s cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose. But this wind carried no threat of storm; already
         he could sense the difference.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Dawn soon,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica nodded.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’s a way to get safely across that open sand,’ Paul said. ‘The Fremen do it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The worms?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,’ Paul said. ‘It’d keep a worm occupied for a time.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other escarpment. ‘Four kilometers’ worth of time?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only <em>natural</em> sounds, the kind that don’t attract the worms …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks
         in the Fremkit manual that had come with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive terror at thought
         of the worms. He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his awareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared
         … if … if …
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He shook his head.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It’d have to be sounds without rhythm,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps … the sand itself must shift down at times. Worms can’t investigate every little sound.
         We should be fully rested before we try it, though.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the vertical moonshadows there. ‘It’ll be dawn within
         the hour.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Where’ll we spend the day?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul turned left, pointed. ‘The cliff curves back north over there. You can see by the way it’s wind-cut that’s the windward
         face. There’ll be crevasses there, deep ones.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Had we better get started?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He stood, helped her to her feet. ‘Are you rested enough for a climb down? I want to get as close as possible to the desert
         floor before we camp.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page279"/>‘Enough.’ She nodded for him to lead the way.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned along the cliff.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>If only we had suspensors,</em> Jessica thought. <em>It’d be such a simple matter to jump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert. Maybe
            they attract the worms the way a shield does.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">They came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading
         along the vestibule.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious the moonlight could not last much longer. They
         wound down into a world of deeper and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The fissure narrowed
         to some ten meters’ width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Can we go down?’Jessica whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I think so.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He tested the surface with one foot.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We can slide down,’ he said. ‘I’ll go first. Wait until you hear me stop.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Careful,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an almost level floor of packed sand. The place
         was deep within the rock walls.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">There came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by
         the cascade. It trailed away to silence.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mother?’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">There was no answer.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Mother?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling; digging, throwing sand like a wild man. ‘Mother!’ he gasped.
         ‘Mother, where are you?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Another cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He wrenched himself out of it.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>She’s been caught in the sandslide,</em> he thought. <em>Buried in it. I must be calm and work this out carefully. She won’t smother immediately. She’ll</em> <a id="page280"/><em>compose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows I’ll dig for her.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">In the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating of his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon
         which the past few moments could write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed itself in his memory,
         moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the total recall.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock
         there. He began to dig, moving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide. A piece of fabric came under his hands. He
         followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm, exposed her face.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you hear me?’ he whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">No answer.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he detected a slow heartbeat.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Bindu suspension,</em> he told himself.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders and pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging
         her as fast as he could, feeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with the effort, fighting
         to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor of the fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into
         a staggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock walls.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert’s marching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently,
         he lowered her to the sand, uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I knew you’d find me,’ she whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked back up the fissure. ‘It might have been kinder if I hadn’t.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Paul!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page281"/>‘I lost the pack,’ he said. ‘It’s buried under a hundred tons of sand … at least.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Everything?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The spare water, the stilltent – everything that counts.’ He touched a pocket. ‘I still have the paracompass.’ He fumbled
         at the waist sash. ‘Knife and binoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we’ll die.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left beyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the
         sand out on the open desert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the rocks.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">But Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul’s face. She edged her voice with scorn, said: ‘Is this the way you were
         taught?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Don’t you understand?’ he asked. ‘Everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You found me,’ she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul squatted back on his heels.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it, marking the looseness of the sand.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a hole dug into the sand, we might be able to put
         down a shaft to the pack. Water might do it, but we don’t have enough water for …’ He broke off, then: ‘Foam.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning of his mind.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as his eyes, finding the direction and then centering
         his attention on a darkened patch of sand below them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Spice,’ he said. ‘Its essence – highly alkaline. And I have the paracompass. Its power pack is acid-base.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica sat up straight against the rock.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind-compacted surface that spilled from the end of the fissure
         to the desert’s floor.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She watched the way he walked, breaking his stride – step … pause, step-step … slide … pause …</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page282"/>There was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of the desert moved here.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his robe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice
         onto the sand in front of Jessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his knife. The compass
         face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts on it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism came out
         next, leaving an empty dished compartment in the instrument.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’ll need water,’Jessica said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it into the dished compartment.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>If this fails, that’s water wasted,</em> Jessica thought. <em>But it won’t matter then, anyway.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">With his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the water. They foamed slightly, subsided.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica’s eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of hawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there
         staring down at the open water.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Great Mother!</em> she thought. <em>They can sense water even at that distance!</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button which gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the
         reworked instrument in one hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying the lay of the slope.
         His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it. He waded part way up the slope, kicking off sand rivulets, spurts of
         dust.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Presently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass, shook the instrument case.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Green foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul aimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began
         kicking away the sand beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica moved to a position below him, called out: ‘May I help?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Come up and dig,’ he said. ‘We’ve about three meters to go. It’s going to be a near thing.’ As he spoke, the foam stopped
         billowing from the instrument.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page283"/>‘Quickly,’ Paul said. ‘No telling how long this foam will hold the sand.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into the hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam
         boiled from it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">As Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the sand down the slope. ‘How deep?’ she panted.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘About three meters,’ he said. And I can only approximate the position. We may have to widen this hole.’ He moved a step aside,
         slipping in loose sand. ‘Slant your digging backward. Don’t go straight down.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica obeyed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Slowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Could I have miscalculated?</em> Paul asked himself. <em>I’m the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion remained.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam-stained hand across her cheek. Her eyes met Paul’s.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The upper face,’ Paul said. ‘Gently, now.’ He added another pinch of spice to the container, sent the foam boiling around
         Jessica’s hands as she began cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole. On the second pass, her hands encountered
         something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of strap with a plastic buckle.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Don’t move any more of it,’ Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper. ‘We’re out of foam.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said: ‘Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I’m
         going to pull you to the side and downhill. Don’t let go of that strap. We won’t get much more spill from the top. This slope
         has stabilized itself. All I’m going to aim for is to keep your head free of the sand. Once that hole’s filled, we can dig
         you out and pull up the pack.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I understand,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ready?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page284"/>‘Ready.’ She tensed her fingers on the strap.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">With one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down.
         When it had subsided, Jessica remained buried to the waist, her left arm and shoulder still under the sand, her chin protected
         on a fold of Paul’s robe. Her shoulder ached from the strain put on it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I still have the strap,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Slowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap. ‘Together,’ he said. ‘Steady pressure. We mustn’t
         break it.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">More sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared the surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from
         the sand. Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">In a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack between them.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Paul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was caked to her where the foam had dried. She looked as
         though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You look a mess,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’re not so pretty yourself,’ she said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">They started to laugh, then sobered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That shouldn’t have happened,’ Paul said. ‘I was careless.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ll put up the tent,’ he said. ‘Better slip off that robe and shake it out.’ He turned away, taking the pack.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There’re anchor holes in the rock,’ Paul said. ‘Someone’s tented here before.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Why not?</em> she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place – deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers
         away – far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">She turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere blending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul <a id="page285"/>stepped past her, lifting his binoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the oil lenses on
         the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There are growing things over there,’ he said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up beside Paul.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There,’ he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She looked where he pointed.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Saguaro,’ she said. ‘Scrawny stuff.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘There may be people nearby,’ Paul said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That could be the remains of a botanical testing station,’ she warned.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘This is pretty far south into the desert,’ he said. He lowered his binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling
         how dry and chapped his lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. ‘This has the feeling of a Fremen place,’
         he said.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?’ she asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Kynes promised their help.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>But there’s desperation in the people of this desert,</em> she thought. <em>I felt some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.</em></p>
      
      <p class="indent">She closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a scene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip
         once on Caladan – she and the Duke Leto, before Paul’s birth. They’d flown over the southern jungles, above the weed-wild
         shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen the ant lines in the greenery – man-gangs carrying their
         loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there’d been the white petals of trimaran dhows.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">All of it gone.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Jessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of the day. Restless heat devils were beginning to
         set the air aquiver out on the open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">A spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure. The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning
         <a id="page286"/>breeze, by the hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sandfall was gone, she still heard it hissing.
         It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Worm,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">It came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored. A twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the
         dunes within their field of vision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then it was gone, coursing
         off to the left.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">The sound diminished, died.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’ve seen space frigates that were smaller,’ Paul whispered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">She nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed
         bitterly endless before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘When we’ve rested,’ Jessica said, ‘we should continue with your lessons.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He suppressed a sudden anger, said: ‘Mother, don’t you think we could do without …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Today you panicked,’ she said. ‘You know your mind and bindu-nervature perhaps better than I do, but you’ve much yet to learn
         about your body’s prana-musculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and I can teach you about this. You must
         learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body. You need review of the hands. We’ll start with finger muscles, palm
         tendons, and tip sensitivity.’ She turned away. ‘Come, into the tent, now.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">He flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the sphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect
         her from this determination … that he must agree.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent"><em>Whatever has been done to me, I’ve been a party to it,</em> he thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Review of the hand!</p>
      
      <p class="indent">He looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm.</p>

      <p class="noindent">‘So you’re the great Gurney Halleck,’ the man said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated behind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes
         and had the half-tint blue eyes that told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space frigate’s master
         control center – communications and view screens along a thirty-degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining,
         and the desk formed as a wall projection – part of the remaining curve.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek,’ the smuggler said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then you’re the one I owe thanks for the help we’ve received,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h-h, gratitude,’ the smuggler said. ‘Sit down.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">A ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck sank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness.
         He could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy
         face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family resemblance in the smuggler now – the father’s heavy,
         overhanging eyebrows and rock planes of cheeks and nose.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens,’ Halleck said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people,’ Tuek said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Anger overcame part of Halleck’s fatigue. He straightened, said: ‘Can you name the traitor?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We are not sure.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch … perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen captive.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I heard.’ Halleck took a deep breath. ‘It appears we’ve a deal more killing ahead of us.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We will do nothing to attract attention to us,’ Tuek said.</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page288"/>Halleck stiffened. ‘But—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You and those of your men we’ve saved are welcome to sanctuary among us,’ Tuek said. ‘You speak of gratitude. Very well;
         work off your debt to us. We can always use good men. We’ll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the slightest open
         move against the Harkonnens.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But they killed your father, man!’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps. And if so, I’ll give you my father’s answer to those who act without thinking; “A stone is heavy and the sand is
         weighty; but a fool’s wrath is heavier than them both.”’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You mean to do nothing about it, then?’ Halleck sneered.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You did not hear me say that. I merely say I will protect our contract with the Guild. The Guild requires that we play a
         circumspect game. There are other ways of destroying a foe.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah-h-h-h-h.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Ah, indeed. If you’ve a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But I warn you that you’re probably too late … and we doubt
         she’s the one you want anyway.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hawat made few mistakes.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You think <em>he’s</em> the traitor?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Tuek shrugged. ‘This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the Harkonnens believe it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Hints and suggestions … rumors and hunches.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We are seventy-four men,’ Halleck said. ‘If you seriously wish us to enlist with you, you must believe our Duke is dead.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘His body has been seen.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And the boy, too – young Master Paul?’ Halleck tried to swallow, found a lump in his throat.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert storm. Likely not even their bones will ever be
         found.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘So the witch is dead then … all dead.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Tuek nodded. ‘And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat of power here on Dune.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page289"/>‘Yes.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">It took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to overcome him. He spoke with panting breath: ‘I’ve
         a score of my own against Rabban. I owe him for the lives of my family …’ He rubbed at the scar along his jaw. ‘… and for
         this …’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely,’ Tuek said. He frowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck’s
         jaw, the sudden withdrawal in the man’s shed-lidded eyes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I know … I know.’ Halleck took a deep breath.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us. There are many places to—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With Rabban here – I stay.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘In your mood, I’m not sure we want you to stay.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck stared at the smuggler. ‘You doubt my word?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘No-o-o …’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’ve saved me from the Harkonnens. I gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no greater reason. I’ll stay on Arrakis – with you
         … or with the Fremen.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power,’ Tuek said. ‘You might find the line between life
         and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him. ‘Where is the Lord who led us through the land of
         deserts and of pits?’ he murmured.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come,’ Tuek said. ‘Speed is a device of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow – we’ve the
         diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart – water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck opened his eyes. ‘I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.’ He stared at Tuek. ‘You think
         that day will come?’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I have little to do with how you’ll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. I can only help you meet today.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent"><a id="page290"/>‘Then I’ll accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge your father and all the others who—’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Listen to <em>me, fighting man,’</em> Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk, his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler’s face was suddenly
         like weathered stone. ‘My father’s water – I’ll buy that back myself, with my own blade.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment the smuggler reminded him of Duke Leto: a leader of men, courageous, secure in
         his own position and his own course. He was like the Duke … before Arrakis.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you wish my blade beside you?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">Tuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you think of me <em>as fighting man?’</em> Halleck pressed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’re the only one of the Duke’s lieutenants to escape,’ Tuek said. ‘Your enemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him
         … You defeated him the way we defeat Arrakis.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Eh?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck,’ Tuek said. Arrakis is our enemy.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘One enemy at a time, is that it?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘That’s it.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Is that the way the Fremen make out?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Perhaps.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You said I might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the desert, in the open, is that why?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man’s land. But I wish to talk more about—’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I’m told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert,’ Halleck said. ‘But there are rumors that you can
         see bits of greenery here and there if you know where to look.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Rumors!’ Tuek sneered. ‘Do you wish to choose now between me and the Fremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch
         carved out of the rock, our own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few ragged bands that
         <em>we</em> use as spice-hunters.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But they can kill Harkonnens.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are <a id="page291"/>being hunted down like animals – with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being exterminated. Why? Because they
         killed Harkonnens.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Was it Harkonnens they killed?’ Halleck asked.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘What do you mean?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Haven’t you heard that there may’ve been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘More rumors.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘But a pogrom – that isn’t like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘I believe what I see with my own eyes,’ Tuek said. ‘Make your choice, fighting man. Me or the Fremen. I will promise you
         sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">Halleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek’s words, yet troubled for no reason he could explain.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Trust your own abilities,’ Tuek said. ‘Whose decisions brought your force through the battle? Yours. Decide.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘It must be,’ Halleck said. ‘The Duke and his son are dead?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, I incline to trust the Harkonnens.’ A grim smile touched Tuek’s
         mouth. ‘But it’s about the only trust I give them.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Then it must be,’ Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and thumb folded flat against it in the traditional
         gesture. ‘I give you my sword.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Accepted.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Do you wish me to persuade my men?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You’d let them make their own decision?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘They’ve followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn’t what they thought it’d be. Here, they’ve lost everything
         except their lives. I’d prefer they decided for themselves now.’
      </p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘Now is no time for you to falter,’ Tuek said. ‘They’ve followed you this far.’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘You need them, is that it?’</p>
      
      <p class="indent">‘We can always use experienced fighting men … in these times more than ever.’</p>
